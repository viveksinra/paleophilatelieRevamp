<h1>Short presentation about Mr. Michael Kogan, the Author and Admin of this website</h1>
</center>


<p>
	I found my first fossil when I was 12-13 years old, in the mid-1980s. 
	It was a tooth of a prehistoric fish in a piece of stone. 
	I took it to the Natural History Museum where an employee explained to me what 
	I had found. 
	It was astonishing, because in Lviv, the Ukrainian city, where I grew up, 
	there was no sea or even a river. 
	Prehistoric creatures began to occupy my imagination. 
	I began to study them, collecting fossils and stamps on the theme. 
	After some time, I had quite a few fossils of ammonites, belemnites, petrified 
	wood and teeth of prehistoric fishes and I dreamt of being a paleontologist.

	Shortly after finishing school, my family emigrated from Ukraine, and my life changed significantly. 
	Adapting to a new country, learning a new language, and completing studies in electronics and computer 
	science (rather than paleontology) took much of my time. 
	Marriage and the start of my professional career left little room for hobbies, 
	but my interest in <a href="links_paleo.html">paleontology</a> never disappeared, and I continued to follow the field whenever possible.

 <p>
	At the end of 2001, I accepted an offer from a German company and moved to Munich, where I still live today. 
	In 2010, while sorting through old books and photographs, I rediscovered my stamp album. 
	Leafing through its pages rekindled my enthusiasm. 
	Searching online, I discovered a surprisingly large number 	of stamps depicting dinosaurs, other prehistoric animals, 
	fossils, and <a href="topics/paleo/paleontologist.html">paleontologists</a>. 
	I was astonished by how many such stamps had been issued since <a href="year/1990.html">1990</a>, the year I had stopped collecting. 
	Nearly every <a href="country/index.html">country</a> had released at least a few issues, and some had produced extensive thematic sets.
 </p>



 <p>
	This discovery prompted me to resume my collection. 
	I collect all kinds of philatelic material related to paleontology, not only 
	<a href="images/stamps.html">mint stamps</a> and <a href="images/fdc.html">First Day Covers</a> (FDCs), 
	but also attractive <a href="images/stamps_used.html">postally used covers</a> featuring relevant stamps or postmarks. <br>
	<br>
	 <em><strong>
		I treat my collection as a "Museum in an Album" and only add items 
		with interesting background stories. 
		I focus on those that genuinely interest me. 
		I also avoid stamps issued by certain countries solely for commercial purposes, 
		with no meaningful historical or scientific background.
	 </strong></em><br>
	<br>
</p>
 
<p>
	After restarting my collection, I searched for <a href="phil_catalogue_trends.html">atalogues</a>c or websites listing 
	paleontology-related stamps and <a href="images/pm.html">postmarks</a>. 
	The only printed catalogue I found was the Domphil catalogue from 2002. 
	Although it was of good quality, many new issues had appeared since its publication. 
	The few thematic websites I encountered offered only basic information, such as title, date of issue, and catalogue number. 
	Some displayed only very small images, while others had none at all, making it difficult to identify specific items. 	
	Furthermore, none provided detailed information about the prehistoric animals depicted or the background of the stamp issues themselves.
</p>

<em>To fill out the gap and to be able to share the information with other collectors,  
	 Paleophilatelie website was created in October 2010.
	</em>
<br>

<br>
The earliest version of the website consisted of two tables created in MS Word, offering an overview of prehistoric-themed stamps. <br>
Simply filling albums with stamps and covers has never been satisfying to me; 
I am far more interested in researching the stories behind each item and learning as much as possible about every new acquisition. 
As information became available, I began creating detailed 
<a href="description/stamps/index.html">description pages</a> and linking them within the tables. <br>
Today, the website contains over <a href="sitemap.html">700 pages</a>  and more than 16,000 
<a href="images/index.html">images</a>.
<br>

<br>
Since 2018, I have submitted this website to many international competitions for philatelic websites 
in the "Electronic Literature" Category.
