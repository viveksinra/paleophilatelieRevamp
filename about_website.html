The website explores how prehistoric life, early humans, fossils, and the scientists who studied them have 
been represented through postage stamps and related postal materials issued around the world. <br>

At its core, the website functions as an online reference and 
<a href="phil_catalogue_main.html">thematic catalogue</a>. <br>

It documents thousands of philatelic items, including 
<a href="images/stamps.html">postage stamps</a>, 
<a href="images/fdc.html">first day covers</a>, 
<a href="images/pm.html">commemorative postmarks</a>, 
<a href="images/ps.html">postal stationery</a>, — each linked to 
<a href="topics/paleo/index.html">paleontological</a> or 
<a href="topics/anthro/index.html">paleoanthropological</a> subjects. 
The material is carefully organized by 
<a href="country/index.html" title="Country Catalogue">country</a> and 
<a href="year/index.html"    title="Date of Issue Catalogue">date of issue</a>, 
allowing visitors to trace the global and historical development of these themes within postal history. <br>

<br>
Paleophilatelie.eu goes beyond simple cataloguing by providing contextual and educational content. <br>
Many entries are accompanied by 
<a href="description/stamps/index.html">background information</a> 
on the depicted organisms, fossil sites, scientific discoveries, and prominent researchers, 
helping bridge the gap between philately and the natural sciences. 
In this way, the site serves not only collectors, but also educators, students, and anyone interested in the cultural representation 
of prehistoric life. <br>
<br>
The website also promotes <em>Paleophilately</em> as a distinct topical collecting field, encouraging deeper 
appreciation of how stamps have been used to communicate scientific knowledge and national heritage. 
By combining documentation, visual material, and accessible explanations, Paleophilatelie.eu helps preserve 
this niche area of collecting and makes it available to a broad international audience. <br>

<h2>Aid in Philatelic Research</h2>

The stamps checklist and the gallery pages of this website can be used to compile a 
<strong>personal topical list</strong>.<br>
By slowly scrolling through the <a href="images/stamps.html">"Postage Stamps" gallery</a> 
or the 
<a href="images/checklist_stamps.html">"Illustrated Checklist of Paleontology and Paleoanthropology related stamps"</a> 
pages, visitors can easily identify and compile all stamps related to a specific subject, 
such as carnivorous dinosaurs, mammoths or fossils of birds, etc. 
In the same way, by scrolling through these galleries, visitors can locate and group together philatelic items related 
to particular themes, species, or geological periods.
<p>
	The same exploratory approach can be applied to the 
	<a href="images/fdc.html">first day cover (fdc)</a>, 
	<a href="images/pm.html">postmarks</a> and 
	<a href="images/ps.html">postal stationeries</a> galleries.
</p> 
 
In this way, 
<a href="images/index.html">the galleries</a> and 
<a href="images/checklist_stamps.html">the checklist</a> encourage active engagement with the material, 
allowing visitors to construct their own thematic collections according to their personal interests or research needs. <br>
<br>
The website also contains numerous <a href="articles/index.html">articles</a> about Postal History, such as 
<a href="articles/1840s.html">The first stamps and postal stationery and the beginning of Philately</a> 
as well as articles related to the website’s thematic focus, including 
<a href="topics/paleo/vertebrate/mammoth.html">The Discovery of the Woolly Mammoth</a> and 
<a href="topics/paleo/personalities/charles_darwin.html">Charles Darwin in Philately</a>. 
Some of these articles include lists of philatelic items related to the subject discussed. <br>

The Paleophilatelie website can be explored on all types of electronic devices, including desktop computers, 
laptops, tablets, and smartphones. <br>
However, <strong>the website is best viewed on a wide screen</strong>, where images, galleries, and text 
layouts can be displayed more clearly and comfortably. <br>
<br>
If a computer or laptop is not available, visitors can still enjoy the website on a tablet or smartphone. 
For the best experience on smaller screens, it is recommend rotating your device to <strong>landscape mode</strong>. 
This allows images to appear larger and helps prevent pages from looking crowded or difficult to navigate. 

Using landscape mode on mobile devices will make browsing galleries, reading articles, and viewing detailed 
philatelic images easier and more enjoyable. <br>
<br>


<br>
<a name="search"></a>
<h2>Search through the website</h2>

The integrated <strong>search bar</strong> can be used to find pages and articles on the website that 
contain the word or phrase a visitor is looking for.
<br>
<u>For example</u>, when the word <q><em>belemnites</em></q> is entered into the search bar, a list of 
articles and pages on the website in which the word “belemnites” is mentioned will be displayed. 
However, the search results will not include all images of postage stamps, and other philatelic materials, 
featuring belemnites.
If the goal is to obtain a complete list of stamps depicting belemnites, it is recommended to browse the 
postage stamp gallery, as described above in the <a href="#aid"><em>Aid in Philatelic Research</em></a>
chapter .<br>
