"<strong>Paleontology</strong>, also spelled Pal<u>ae</u>ontology, scientific study of life of the geologic past that involves
	the analysis of plant and animal fossils, including those of microscopic size, preserved in rocks. It is concerned
	with all aspects of the biology of ancient life forms: their shape and structure, evolutionary patterns, taxonomic
	relationships with each other and with modern living species, geographic distribution, and interrelationships with
	the environment. Paleontology is mutually interdependent with stratigraphy and historical geology because fossils
	constitute a major means by which sedimentary strata are identified and correlated with one another. Its methods of
	investigation include that of biometry (statistical analysis applied to biology), which is designed to provide a
	description of the forms of organisms statistically and the expression of taxonomic relationships quantitatively."

 Do you know when and which country issued the first dinosaur stamp ?     <br>
 Do you know who was the first paleontologist honored on a stamp ?        <br>
 These, and other interesting facts can be found throughout this article. <br>
</em>
</big></big>
<br>

<br>
The first stamps issued in the mid-19th century have boring designs.
They were rectangular or square in shape, depicting the leader of the
country: king, queen, president, or had just a face value. Even though
people around the world began collecting stamps almost immediately. The
first philatelists tried to find production differences between stamps
of the same design—color or paper variations, difference in
perforation, some errors on images, etc. <br>
It took over 30 years until the first commemorative stamp was
issued. In 1871, Peru issued a stamp showing a locomotive. Shortly
after, many other postal authorities began issuing stamps dedicated to
important events, local and worldwide famous places, landscapes, famous
persons of the county, etc. Nowadays postage stamps are not only
evidence of postal payment, but also ambassadors of the country. They
tell us a story of the issuing country, shows us famous persons,
landscapes and scenic sights, cultural and sporting events, and local
flora and fauna. <br>
The fossilized remains of prehistoric animals, especially large ones,
such as dinosaurs or giant mammals, have always stirred the imagination
of people, creating all sorts of myths and legends about Dragons,
Cyclops, and ancient Giants. The well-preserved remains of the ancient
inhabitants of the earth have very great scientific and material value.
Some of them even have the status of national treasure. <br>

<br>
Drawing by Robert Bruce HORSFALL for “<span style="font-style: italic;">A History of Land Mammals in the Western Hemisphere</span>“, by
Robert BERRYMAN Scoot, 1913, shows a saber-toothed cat (<em>Smilodon californicus</em>) and a dire wolf (<em>Canis dirus</em>) 
fighting over a Columbian mammoth (<em>Mammuthus columbi</em>) carcass in the La Brea Tar Pits.<br>
<br>
The La Brea tar pits is very famous because of the huge range of fossils, especially of predators like Smilodon. <br>
By the way, Sabre tooth cat (Smilodon) is the heraldic animal of California and it designated as the official state fossil in 1973.<br>
<br>

There is also a tetrapod dinosaur in the background, who lived much earlier as Smilodon and Neanderthal, and some marine
shells on the foreground and as also part of the logo of the companyy.<br>
The company used fossils of prehistoric animals to make their
fertilizer. [A fertilizer is any material of natural
or synthetic origin (other than liming materials) that is applied to
soils or to plant tissues to supply one or more plant nutrients
essential to the growth of plants.] <br>
Very strange use of fossils in today's point of view.<br>

only earlier item that can be consider is a post card from Germany
(Postcards without imprinted stamps are not subject of philately, but
Deltiology).<br>
Dinosaur, perhaps <em>Plateosaurus</em>, shown on its illustration and some Ad
text
underneath. The issue date of the postcard from Germany is unknown,
sent in 1912 from Solingen.<br>
<em>Plateosaurus</em> lived during the Late Triassic period, around 214 to 204 million years ago,
in what is now Central and Northern Europe.<br>
Discovered in 1834 by Johann Friedrich Engelhardt and described three years later
by Hermann von Meyer, <em>Plateosaurus</em> was the fifth named dinosaur genus
that is still considered valid. Although it had been described before
Richard Owen formally named Dinosauria in 1842, it was not one of the
three genera used by Owen to define the group, because at the time, it
was poorly known and difficult to identify as a dinosaur. It is now
among the dinosaurs best known to science: over 100 skeletons have been
found, some of them nearly complete. The abundance of its fossils in
Swabia, Germany, has led to the nickname Schwäbischer Lindwurm (Swabian
lindworm). More info is on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plateosaurus">Wikipedia</a>.

<a href="images/milestones/item1a.jpg"><img style="border: 0px solid ; width: 420px; height: 273px; float: left;" src="images/milestones/item1.jpg" alt="first meter farnking with dinosaurs" title="first meter farnking with dinosaurs, Click to enlarge" hspace="4"></a>From
the nineteen thirties until the fifties, the Sinclair Oil Company
used this meter franking, as well as <a href="images/others/sinclair_dino_ad_1931.jpg">regular advertisements</a>
to advertise their motor oil. <br>
Dinosaur became so popular in USA that Sinclair registered him as a trademark in 1932.
The corporation's logo features the silhouette of a large green Sauropod dinosaur - <em>Brontosaurus</em>, 
based on the then-common idea that oil deposits beneath the earth came from the dead bodies of dinosaurs.
</p>

The corporation even sponsored dinosaurs excavation by famous American paleontologist Barnum Brown, 
who dug for dinosaur bones in summer 1934 at the Morrison formation at the place called now Howe Quarry.<br>
This Brown's expedition was big success. More than 20 skeletons and 4.000 bones excavate there.
One of the unearthed dinosaurs was <em>Diplodocus</em> - another long neck dinosaur, who had similar 
shape as Brontosaurus, but smaller in size.
<br><br>
This  <em>Brontosaurus</em> of Sinclair Oil is commonly known as DINO.<br>
A life-size DINO appeared in the “Century of Progress” Chicago World’s Fair in 1933-1934, 
along with several other dinosaurs built by P.G. Alen, who was known for creating lifelike 
papier-mâché animals for motion pictures.<br>
<br>
Following the Chicago World’s Fair, in 1935 the company began published dinosaur stamps like labels – 
and a  stamp album that could be filled only with colored dinosaur "stamps" issued one at 
a time weekly at Sinclair service stations. <br>
This kind of "stamps" known as Cinderella in philatelic community and
are  <a href="images/others/sinclair_dino_stamps_1935.jpg">the first
Cinderella set of stamps depicting prehistoric animals ever</a>.
<br>
<p>These were intended for children. In each program when you went to
a Sinclair station on week one you would be given a stamp
album. Then on each 8 following week you would be given a new sheetlet
of stamps. The books had some advertising material but mostly contained
scientific and historical information to explain the dinosaurs and petroleum to
children.</p>

FDCs (First Day Cover) with a dinosaur and prehistoric animal illustration</big> </strong></big></p>
<p> On 10.08.1946, the U.S. Post Office Department issued a stamp to
celebrate the centenary (100 anniversary) of the Smithsonian Institution.
<br>
The stamp itself shows the Smithsonian's buildings in Washington
(Actually <a href="images/sets/others/usa_1946.jpg">this
stamp </a>itself can be consider as a stamp of paleontologic thematic as the Institute has
very large Paleobiology Department). Several FDC with the Smithsonian
stamp shows some Dinosaurs and other prehistoric animals on its illustrations.
<a href="images/milestones/usa_1946_fdc.jpg"><img style="border: 0px solid ; width: 950px; height: 185px;" src="images/milestones/t_usa_1946_fdc.jpg" alt="first FDC (First Day Cover) with dinosaurs on it" title="first FDC (First Day Cover) with dinosaurs, Click to enlarge" hspace="0"></a><br>
As illustration on the left side of the first FDC shows a sauropod,
most likely a <em>Diplodocus</em>. <em>Stegosaurs</em> and <em>Morophus</em> (prehistoric mammal) shown on others.
<br>
<i><u>Note</u>: all these FDCs are personalized
(made by some dealers or individuals). US Post doesn't produce any FDC and don't make any
commemorative postmarks associated with their stamps.</i>
<br>
On February 7, 1996 the U.S. Post Office Department issued a stamp
to celebrate the 150 anniversary of the Smithsonian Institution.
Similar to 1946, some dinosaurs can be seen on illustration of FDC
covers. <a href="images/fdc/others/usa_1996_smithsonian_fdc1.jpg">Here</a>
is one of them, shows Tyrannosaurus on it.

a <span style="font-weight: bold;">paleontologist</span>
has been issued in USSR on January 17, 1947.
Actually it is a set of <a href="images/sets/ussr_1947_karpinski.jpg">two stamps</a>
30 kopejka(100 kopejka = 1
rubel), green and 50 kopejka sepia. These stamps are show a
portrait of
<span style="font-weight: bold;">A.P.
Karpinskij </span>(1847-1936), who is most known as First
elected president of Russian
Science Academic. However, he was also great geologist and
paleontologist, who made some important discovers at Ural mountains
area of Russia. <br>
<i>Note:
there are nothing on the stamp that indicate on Paleontology </i>
</p>
<p>On 3 March 1952, Soviet Union issues a stamp titled
"<span style="font-weight: bold;">Greatest Russian</span>
scientist biologist-<span style="font-weight: bold;">paleontologist</span>:
<span style="font-weight: bold;">W.O. Kovalevskij</span>"
with a face value of 40 kopejka and this is
actually the first stamp dedicated to paleontologist.</p>
<p>Vladimir Onufreivich Kowalewskij (1784-1856)
Russian paleontologist and supporter of Darwinism. He was the
one who assumed horses are appeared first in Europe continent then
migrate to North America, then come back to Europe. Evidence of this
theorie found more then 100 years after his suicide due to
some trouble in private and commercial life in Grube Messel
by Darmstadt, Germany. Very little prehistoric horse in size
of a big dog was found there and depicting on stamp of BRD in 1978.</p>

first stamp of scientists with a prehistoric animal fossil on a background has been issued in
<a href="country/romania.html">Romania</a> on
29 July 1967, as part of <a href="images/sets/Romania_1967.jpg">set
of famous Romanian people</a>. The green stamp with a value of 40
bani shows Romanian biologist and director of
Museum of Natural History <span style="font-weight: bold;">Grigores
Antipa</span> (1867-1944). Some websites and even philatelic
books and catalogs mentioned this stamp as the first stamp depicting paleontologist on.
Actually, he was not a paleontologist at all - he was
the zoologist, ichthyologist, economist, ecologist,
oceanology, museologist. He founded the Romanian school of
Hydrobiology, Ichthyology and Oceanology, was pioneer in the field of
museology, the author of modern concepts in ecology, biosociologiei,
biosphere.<br>
As director of the Museum of Natural History in
Bucharest, he had an important contribution to the organization on a phylogenetic and
ecological collections. As a token of gratitude for his work in the
museum since 1933, the museum now bears his name. The confusion is
caused by <strong>fossil of <em>Dinotherium giganteum</em></strong> depicting
on a background of the stamp. It is there just because it is the most impressive exhibit of the museum.</p>

<p><a name="contributors"></a>Another
category of persons to mention is "<big><span style="font-weight: bold;">Contributors to Paleontological
science</span></big>"</p>
<p>People have found fossils since ancient times, but Paleontology as a
science was established in the middle of the 19th century. The
establishment was impossible without the help of scientists from many other
sciences such as biology, botany, and geology. Many politicians and
wealthy persons supported the young
science. <br>

<a href="images/sets/others/sweden_1939_linnei.jpg"><img title="Carl Linnaeus on stamp of Sweden 1939, Click to enlarge" style="border: 0px solid ; width: 200px; height: 216px; float: left;" alt="Carl Linnaeus on stamp of Sweden 1939" src="images/milestones/sweden_1939_linnei_1.jpg" hspace="4"></a><a href="images/sets/ecuador_1936_darwin.jpg"><img title="Charles Darwin on stamp of Ecuador 1936, Click to enlarge" style="border: 0px solid ; width: 200px; height: 242px; float: right;" alt="Charles Darwin on stamp of Ecuador 1936" src="images/milestones/ecuador_1936_darwin.jpg" hspace="4"></a>
Modern biology, botany, and of course paleontology classifies
all animals and plants according a taxonomic system proposed by Swedish
botanist <span style="font-weight: bold;">Carl Linnaeus</span>
(1707
- 1778) in the mid-18th century. The first stamp honoring Linnaeus was issued
by Sweden on 2 June 1939. <br>
<br>
The
foundation of Paleontology is the evolutionary theory of <span style="font-weight: bold;">Charles
Darwin</span> (1809 -1882 ), who published his famous work, "On the Origin
of Species by <br>
Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in
the Struggle for Life", in 1859. <br>
</p>
<p>The fact that evolution occurs became accepted by the scientific
community and much of the general public in his lifetime, while his
theory of natural selection came to be widely seen as the primary
explanation of the process of evolution in the 1930s, and now forms the
basis of modern evolutionary theory. In modified form, Darwin's
scientific discovery is the unifying theory of the life sciences,
providing logical explanation for the diversity of life. In
recognition of Darwin's pre-eminence, he was one of only five
19th-century UK non-royal personages to be honoured by a state funeral,
and was buried in Westminster Abbey, close to John Herschel and Isaac
Newton. Darwin's work had far-reaching impacts on the development of
Paleontology, Antropology and many other Biology and Psyology related scients.
<br>
There are many stamps of Darwin issued across the world to date. The very first stamp issued in <a href="images/sets/ecuador_1936_darwin.jpg">Ecuador in 1936</a> 
(printed in 1935) to commemorate anniversary of his visit on Galapagos islands.

is rightfully renowned as the
principal author of the Declaration

the United States, and a champion
of liberty. But he was also a
central player in the beginnings of
American paleontology. In addition, his
participation occurred at a time when
people were struggling with the
ideas of fossils as evidence of
past life, of extinction, and of
an Earth far older than the
Biblical account. <br>
Some of the objects of Jefferson’s paleontology
became part of the collections at
the American Philosophical Society in
Philadelphia. Beginning in 1849, these
holdings were transferred to the
Academy of Natural Sciences of
Philadelphia, where they are currently
housed. This is the Thomas

To <a href="images/fdc/india_1951_fdc_calcutta.jpg">commemorate
the Indian Geological Survey centenary</a> on 13 January 1951,
India Post released a stamp showing two prehistoric “elephants”
(Stegodon ganesa), the first ever reconstruction of a prehistoric
animal on a stamp. <br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Stegodons </span>
were primarily an Asiatic group of Mammutidae. This family is believed
to have evolved sometime by the middle Miocene, nearly 15 million years
ago, and became extinct by the late Pleistocene about 30,000–40,000
years ago. Stegodons appear to be transitional between true mastodons
on the one hand and true elephants on the other. <br>

<i>Why are Stegodons depicting on stamps for the anniversary of the Indian Geological Survey?</i>
<br>
</div>
In 1928, a three-meter long fossil tusk of an elephantine mammal
(Stegodon ganesa) was discovered by <span style="font-weight: bold;">Dr. Darashaw Nosherwan Wadia</span>
(1883–1969) who pursued his personal research on stratigraphy,
structure, and paleontology of the Kashmir Himalayan region with
single-minded devotion. Being a very keen observer, he worked towards
identification of broad structural elements of the northwest Himalayas.
The discovery of this skull, which was found in association with fossil
ganoid fish and pteridospermous plants, led to the fixing of the age of
an important geological rock formation in the Kashmir Himalayas to the
Permo-Carboniferous period (355–250 million years ago). The fossil tusk
is now kept at the museum of the Geology Department of the Jammu
University. <br>
<br>
<p style="margin: 3.75pt 0cm 15pt; font-style: italic;">Note: On
March 4, 2001 another stamp was issued by the Department of
Post, Government of India, to commemorate 150 anniversary of Indian

In that year, the XIX International Geological Congress was held in
Algeria. The host country issued two special stamps on August 11<sup>th</sup> to promote this event.<br>
<br>
The ammonite fossil depicting on the 15-franc stamp is <em>Berbericeras sikikensis</em>.
Ammonites are excellent index fossils, and it is often possible to link the rock layer in which they
are found to specific geological time periods. Therefore, they appear on several philatelic items related to some geological events.<br>
<br>
The second stamp, denominated 30fr, shows one of the most famous geological sites in the country—the Hoggar Mountains.

<p>On 15 April 1958, the People’s Republic of China issued a set of three stamps titled, “<a href="description/stamps/china_1958.html">Chinese
Paleontology</a>.”<br>
The 8-fen stamp depicts fossil and reconstruction of <em>Lufengosaurus</em>. <br>

<br>Another two stamps, see on the right side,
shows trilobite (<em>Kaolishania pustulosa</em>) of Haoli Mountain from
Paleozoic and the Chinese giant deer (<em>Megaloceros</em>
[=Sinomegaceros] pachyosteus) from Cenozoic. <br>
<br>
<em>Lufengosaurus</em>, meaning Lufeng lizard, is a genus of
sauropod dinosaur from the early and middle Jurassic period of what is
now southwestern China. It was named by Chinese Paleontologist by C. C. Young in 1941.<br>
This is one of the few prosauropod dinosaurs to survive from the early Jurassic era. <br>
Prosauropods, meaning “before the sauropods,” were small, herbivorous dinosaurs closely related to the giant
sauropods of the late Jurassic period. This dinosaur became the first
complete dinosaur skeleton to be mounted in China and displayed in Beijing. <br>

<span style="font-style: italic;">One of the methods
the organization uses to collect donations is the
issue of semi-postal stamps. The first stamp set was issued in 1938.</span>
<br>
</div>
<p> All sets contain five stamps: one
stamp with a logo of the
Pro Patria campaign and four stamps showing minerals and fossils. The
additional amount paid for each sold stamp
transferred to the organization. Actually, these are the first
semi-postal stamps with a paleontological context ever
issued. <br>
<br>
The set from 1961, distinguished from others, contains two fossil
stamps: a fish and a plant. Both are the first stamps in their
category. The <span style="font-weight: bold;">fish</span>
is very likely Scorpaena porcus and the fern <span style="font-weight: bold;">plant</span> is probably
Asterotheca meriani. Asterotheca is a genus dating from the
Permian period 299–252 MYA. It
grew in humid and swampy locales and was one of the first plants on the
earth. <br>
<br>
Plant fossils are the subject of Paleobotany study. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Paleobotany</span> is the
branch of paleontology dealing with the recovery and identification of
plant remains from geological
contexts, and their use for the biological reconstruction of past
environments. It includes the evolutionary history of plants, with a
bearing upon the evolution of life in general. Paleobotany is important
in the reconstruction of ancient ecological systems and climate, known
as paleoecology and paleoclimatology, respectively. It is also
fundamental to the study of green plant development and evolution.<br>

The first colorful, pictorial stamps depicting
prehistoric animals were issued on 5 March 1965 by Polish Post who
liked to popularize discoveries of the national paleontologists. <a href="description/stamps/poland_1965.html">The set of ten
stamps</a> show representations of prehistoric animals, mostly
dinosaurs. <br>

<p>
The designs are based on pictures by <strong>Zdenek Burian</strong>, a
Czech painter and book illustrator,<br>
whose work during a remarkable career spanning five decades, played a
central role in the development of paleontological reconstructions.<br>
Originally recognized only native <a href="country/czechoslovakia.html">Czechoslovakia</a>,
Burian’s fame later spread to an international audience, and a number 
of attempted emulate his style. <br>
Burian is regarded by many as the most influential paleo-artist of the
modern era. Many stamps issued around the world are based on his illustrations.

<br>
In the following year <a href="country/poland.html">Poland</a> issues another stamps set with prehistoric
animals from fish till mammoth that supposed to show animal evolution.
The first stamps set dedicated to prehistoric mammals issued in the same year in <a href="country/romania.html">Romania</a>
that shows reconstruction of the animals and their skeletons.

stamps</a> with some typical animals, landscapes, and some
historical episodes to show development of the country. <br>
The 1.30sh stamp shows a skull of <em>Zinjanthropus</em> and its excavation site
at Olduvai Gorge valley. <em>Zinjanthropus</em>, later
categorized as <em>Paranthropus boisei</em>, is an extinct hominid postulated
from a skull discovered in Olduvai Gorge, Tanzania, by British
paleoanthropologist, Mary Leakey on 17 July 1959. Perhaps she

</p>
<p>For much of her career, <span style="font-weight: bold;">Mary Leakey</span>
(1913–1996) worked together with her husband, Louis Leakey (1903–1972),
in Olduvai Gorge, uncovering the tools and fossils of ancient hominids.
She developed a system for classifying the stone tools found at
Olduvai. She also discovered the Laetoli footprints. It was
there, at the Laetoli site, that she discovered hominid fossils that
were more than 3.75 million-years-old. In addition, she discovered 15
new species of other animals, and one new genus. <br>
<br>
In 1960, she became director of excavation at Olduvai and subsequently
took it over, building her own staff. After the death of her husband,
she became a leading paleoanthropologist, helping to establish the
Leakey tradition in the field. Mary Leakey died on 9 December 1996, at
the age of 83, a renowned paleoanthropologist, who had not only
conducted significant research of her own, but had been invaluable to
the research careers of her husband and their sons, Richard, Philip,
and Jonathan<br>

<p> On 31 March 1967, Post
Authority of Cuba issued a set of seven stamps that were the first to
show human evolution. Each stamp shows a skull stage of the human
relevant and depicts major stage of human development
known from worldwide fossil record. <br>
<br>
The first two stamps show very early species: <span style="font-weight: bold;">Homo habilis</span>, who
lived between roughly 2.8 to 1.5 MYA, and Australopithecus. From
paleontological and archaeological evidence, the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Australopithecus</span>
genus apparently evolved in eastern Africa around 4 MYA
before spreading throughout the continent and eventually becoming
extinct sometime after 2 MYA. <br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Pithecanthropus
erectus</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold;">Sinanthropus
pekinensis</span> both belong to the Homo erectus group that
lived between 1.9 MYA and 700,000 years ago. Pithecanthropus erectus is
known from fossils found at the bank of the Solo River at Trinil, in
East Java. Fossils of Sinanthropus pekinensis, also known as Peking
Man, are found in China. <br>
<br>
The <span style="font-weight: bold;">Neanderthals</span>,
or Neandertals, are closely related to modern humans, differing in DNA
by just 0.12 percent. Remains left by Neanderthals include bone and
stone tools, which are found in Eurasia, from Western Europe to Central
and Northern Asia as well as in North Africa. Neanderthals
are generally classified by biologists as the species Homo
neanderthalensis, but some considers them to be a subspecies of Homo
sapiens (Homo sapiens neanderthalensis). <br>
<br>
The final Homo species shown on these stamps is the modern Homo
sapiens. The 13c and 20c stamps show<span style="font-weight: bold;">
Cro-Magnon</span> men. These are the first early modern
humans that lived in Europe in the Upper Paleolithic period from
500,000 to 10,000 years ago. Current scientific literature prefers the
term European early modern humans (EEMH). Fossils of this species are
found in Italy, Britain, and even in Arctic regions. <br>
<br>
All stamps of this set use illustrations by the famous Czech painter
and book illustrator, Zdenek Burian, from a book titled Prehistoric
Man, published in 1960. <br>

is the study of fossilized footprints. Scientists can learn
many things from such tracks. They can give an idea about

behavioral of the animal. Many sites have been found with numerous
tracks giving information on the social behavior of the animals,
whether they traveled in herds, pairs, or alone. In addition to all of
this, scientists can learn the animal’s foot anatomy and foot padding. <br>

<p>
	Souvenir-Sheet is a small sheet containing one or more stamps with wide margins, 
	usually with illustration or inscription.
	The first Souvenir-Sheet was issued by the Post of Luxembourg in 1923. <br>
	They became more of a collectors item with pictorial issues around 1970.<br>
	In 1971 <a href="country/manama.html">Manama</a> issued the first stamp
	set with the Souvenir-Sheet with stamp of <a href="topics/paleo/vertebrate/mammoth.html">woolly mammoth</a> 
	and other prehistoric animals on the margins.</p>


<p>The set contains eight stamps showing various prehistoric animals, mostly dinosaurs, and a miniature
sheet with a mammoth on a 10-riyal stamp along with some other
prehistoric animals on the margin. The animal depicting on the
stamp is a wooly mammoth (Elephas primigenius), a species that lived
during the Pleistocene epoch from 2.588 million years ago (MYA) to
11,700 years ago, and was one of the last in the line of mammoth
species. </p>
<p>From the 1960s until the end of the
1980s, some small Middle Eastern countries (called “<span style="font-weight: bold;">Sand Dunes</span>” by
philatelists) produced stamps in huge quantities for every popular
topic: space, sports, famous people, etc. These stamps were aimed at
stamp collectors rather than postal use and usually were never
available in the country of origin to actually use on letters as
postage. One such set is from <a href="country/fujeira.html">Fujeira</a>
(<a href="year/196x.html">1968</a>). <br>

<p>In
the nineteen seventies and -eighties, rebel groups attempting to
overthrow the Oman government took control over parts of the country on
the Arabian peninsula. In order to raise funds and to establish
themselves as rightful rulers, stamps were issued under the names
'State of Oman' and ' Dhufar'.<br>
In 1980, a set of prehistoric
animals was issued under both names. Both issues consist of eight
values in a sheet (perforate and inperforate ) and an inperforate
miniature sheet. 'Used' covers exist, but all are addressed to a stamp
dealer.<br>
Since then many companies and individuals have printed stamps depicting
various prehistoric animals, mostly dinosaurs, using the names of
non-existent countries to make money from inexperienced collectors. <br>

<p>Traditionally stamps were printed in sheets of several similar stamps, later on
postal authorities started to produce stamp sets on sheets. Such sheets
were usually designed as a big picture composed of many different
stamps. On one hand, it is nice to have a whole picture, but on the
other hand, these occupy a large space in an album and are not useful
for non-philatelist customers. <br>
<br>
The first sheet like this with a prehistoric theme was issued on 6
November 1990 by the South American country of Guyana. It contained
twenty different stamp depicting South American prehistoric animals.<br>
By the way, most stamps of prehistoric animals thematic is issued by
Guyana and have just one target - to be collected. 
There are no real story behind these stamps - just a nice colorful images of various prehistoric animals.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Leaellynasaura</span>, 
about the size of a chicken with a skull only 6
centimetres long, Leaellynasaura was a bipedal herbivorous dinosaur.
Its eyes were exceptionally large, as was the part of the brain
dedicated to processing visual signals (the optic lobes). It would
appear to have been adapted for life in semi-darkness. During much of
the Cretaceous, when Leaellynasaura lived, Australia was far closer to
the South Pole than it is now, and would have been almost continuously
dark for two or three months of each year. It has been suggested that
this little dinosaur, too small to migrate,remained active throughout
the long winter.
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Ornithocheirus</span>,
flying reptiles or pterosaurs were not dinosaurs. However, they lived
at the same time and were warm-bloodedthe energy demands of flight
could never be met with a cold-blooded metabolism. Ornithocheirus lived
in the Late Cretaceous and is also found in Europe, South America and
Africa. During the 19th century, in England many fragmentary
pterosaur fossils were found in the Cambridge Greensand. First found in
Australia in 1979, near Boulia in south-western Queensland. It was a
coastal species, and had a wing span of about 2.5 metres.<br>

<p>On 22 April 1998, the Singapore Post introduced the
first automatic teller machine (ATM) stamps depicting dinosaurs. <br>
The sheet of 15 stamps, with "For the local address only" face value,
was sold exclusively via OCBC (Oversea Chinese Banking Corporation)
bank terminals for a limited period of time. The sheets were designed
with exactly the same dimensions (156×74 mm) as the SGD 50 currency
note and very thin (less than 0.13 mm) so that they could be issued
through the same aperture. These stamps are also the thinnest stamps
related to Paleontology. <br>
Within that period, two
different designs of the backside were
issued, as shown on the right.. <br>
</p>
<p>The stamps shows the following dinosaurs (from left to
right):</p>
<p>The <span style="font-weight: bold;">Pentucerutops</span>
("five horned face") belongs to the family of Cerutopsidae. They looked
like the rhinoceros and were plant-eaters with huge heads, bulky bodies
and heavy limbs and hooike claws. </p>
<p>The <span style="font-weight: bold;">Apatosaurus</span>
("deceptive lizard") was from the family of Diplodocidae. The
Diplodocids stood highest at the hips, earing weight upon their
elephantine limbs with short broad "hands" and feet. The Apatosaurus
were plant-eaters which existed in the Late Iurassic period, and were
very large with long whiplash tail and long neck. <br>
</p>
<p>The <span style="font-weight: bold;">Albertosuurus</span>
("Alberta lizards") was related to the Tyrannosaurus (or T-rex)
featured in the movies. They were fierce predatory animal
that
ran fast and they would lunge with their heads to take "scoop bites"
from their victims bodies. <br>

<a href="#atm">Next year</a>, in November
1999, the Postal Services of Portugal introduced a new set of Frama
machine labels titled “<a href="description/stamps/portugal_1999.html">Dinosaurs of
Portugal</a>”, shows some dinosaur species and some of their
footprints found near Lourinha city. The
area of Lourinha is known by the Late Jurassic findings of dinosaurs
and
other fossils, and give the name for Lourinh
Formation. <br>

<ul style="margin-left: 200px;">
<li><span style="font-style: italic;">FRAMA
labels are
variable value stamps issued by a machine similar to an ATM. The user
chooses the value at the time the stamp is dispensed. They are very
similar to meter stamps.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-style: italic;">Another
ATM-FRAMA of dinosaurs issued by the Postal Services of Portugal in </span><a style="font-style: italic;" href="description/stamps/portugal_2015.html">2015</a><span style="font-style: italic;">. </span></li>
<li><span style="font-style: italic;">So far
(2017) only Portugal issued ATM-FRAMA stamps with prehistoric animals.</span></li>
</ul>
These stamps had seven predefined values from PTE 50 to PTE
350 and printed in two different ATM machines: Amiel and SMD. <br>
Amiel
machine used big and bold font, SMD printed the text in small, regular
font. Some machines used black ink rather than blue one, such stamps
are very difficult to get. <br>
Moreover ATM machines at philatelic desk of Portuguese Post
programmed differently as ATM machines at post offices. Stamps sold to
philatelist used a dot (".") as currency separator, when stamps sold at
post offices used a comma (",") as currency separator, therefore mint
stamps with comma separator are more difficult to get. <br>
With introduction of common European currency the ATM machines were
reprogrammed to print face value in Escudo and Euro currency
in <a href="description/stamps/portugal_2000.html">
2000</a> and Euro only in <a href="description/stamps/portugal_2002.html">2002</a>.<br>

<p>The first 3D stamp set has

Africa in 2009</a>. <br>
The
South African Post Office is combining pre-history with modern
technology by using the anaglyph method to create a three-dimensional
effect.<br>
This set
of stamps is the first ever with a 3D effect to be issued by the South
African Post Office. It will also be the first time that a pair of
viewing glasses will be supplied with each stamp sheet and
commemorative cover.<br>
An anaglyph is a stereo image that requires special glasses with red and
green (or blue) lenses for 3D viewing. To achieve the effect,
two views of a picture are printed in two colours, usually red for the left eye
and blue or green for the right eye.</p>

<p> There are two mini-sheets
4 and 6 stamps each as well as two FDC cards. Five of the
stamps depict skeletons of different types of dinosaurs, while the
other five stamps show images of what scientists believe these
creatures most probably looked like. All the dinosaurs depicting on the
stamps have an African connection.</p>
