If you like the site, find it useful and like to support it - you are welcome
to donate what ever amount you like on <strong>PayPal</strong> account of the Site Admin,
or access Amazon stores through one of links distributed over the website.<br>
Collection  of some Paleophilately related books with links to international Amazon store can be found
on the <a href="media/index.html">Madia</a> page, for example. <br>
<p>
	<strong>Amazon</strong> will give some small % of every purchase to the site. <br>
	It doesn't cost you any more, but it really helps out here.  <br>
	The price is the same, the difference is that a small percentage supports this site.  <br>
	If you usually buy on the Amazon you can support this website without spending
	anything more than that expended by buying directly from an e-shops to which they are associated.
