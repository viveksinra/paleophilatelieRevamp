<h3>What stamps do you collect: mint, CTO or used?</h3>
 <p>
	As a topical collector, I like to see every detail on the stamp, therefore I collect mint stamps.  <br>
	Mint stamps are more expensive, but also more valuable and usually increase their value with the time.
	I do add some CTO (cancelled to order) stamps, mostly Souvenir Sheets with clear commemorative postmarks. <br>
	I also have very few used stamps, but those are exceptions. 
	For example, some old and expensive stamps <br>
	98%-99% of my stamps are mint stamps in full sets. 
 </p>

<h3>What do you do with stamps of sets including different topics?</h3>
<p>
	In most cases, I place irrelevant stamps in a dedicated stock book. <br>
	It is often the case for famous personalities. 
	<a href="../topics/paleo/contributors.html#darwin">Charles Darwin</a>, 
	for example, often appears in sets of “Anniversaries of famous personalities” or 
	“Famous Naturalist/Explorers/Inventors” together with other personalities who had 
	nothing to do with 
	<a href="../topics/paleo/index.html">Paleontology</a> or 
	<a href="../topics/anthro/index.html">Paleoanthropology</a>. 
	There are also some sets with a mix of prehistoric and modern animals.

<h3>How do you store your stamps?</h3>
<p>
	<em>I store my stamps in stock books.</em> 
	It is an easier and economical solution. <br>
	When I started collecting, I had only one stock book 
	that held all my stamps: a few pages for fossil stamps, 
	a few pages for stamps of  prehistoric animals etc. 
	Now, after 15 years of serious collecting I have a dozen stock books.
	Stamps of fossils, prehistoric animals, personalities, Natural History Museums 
	and fossil locations are stored in different stock books. <br>
	As I have 5 stock books with dinosaur stamps, I sorted them per continent: 
	one stock book for stamps of North and South America, another for Europe, etc.
	To maintain my stamps easily, I keep stamps of different topics in stock books 
	with covers of different colours: fossils – black cover, dinosaurs – green, 
	other prehistoric animals – brown, etc.
</p>


<br>
<br>
<a name="qa4"></a>
<h3>What stock books do you use?</h3>
<p>
	<em>Most of my stock books are A4 size with 60 or 64 pages, 
	depending on the production company. </em>
	I also have 30-32 page stock books for special topics. <br>
	One of the 30 pages red stock book is filled with stamps 
	of <a href="../topics/paleo/contributors.html#darwin">Charles Darwin</a> for example. 
	Every stock book is placed in a slip case for better preservation. <br>
	I also have some A5 stock books which I take with me to the stamps shows 
	and trade events, to store acquired stamps.
	I also have an extra stock book for oversized stuff, like large covers and stamp sheets. 
	My stock books occupy several shelves in a bookshelf located in the corridor between two bedrooms. 
	There is more or less constant temperature and no windows in the corridor, 
	to keep the stock books away from direct sunlight.

<a name="qa5"></a>
<h3>Do you try to collect all stamps and covers issued in the world related to your topics?</h3>
<p>
	<em>No, of course not</em>.  <br>
	There are too many stamps and covers related to 
	<a href="../topics/paleo/index.html">Paleontology</a> and 
	<a href="../topics/anthro/index.html">Paleoanthropology</a>
	produced over <a href="../year/index.html">the last 75 years</a> and many more 
	are produced <a href="../year/current.html">each year</a>. <br>
	Some collectors like to have a “complete” collection, which includes every stamp produced anywhere. 
	It is a challenge, especially due to the fact there are some agencies which print 1.000 or more stamps 
	per year for a single country they represent - and even may include 50-100 stamps with a 
	prehistoric theme for a single set! <br>

	<br>
	<table  width="950px">
		<tr>
			<td><a href="../images/sets/car_2022.jpg"><img height="250px"

	</table>
	<br>


	Therefore, collectors who try to get a “complete” collection usually limit themselves by the location, 
	dinosaur stamps of Europe for example, or by the issue date, such as stamps issued prior to 2000. <br>
    <br>

	The problem with the issue date limit is where to set the line.
	Should you stop by 2010, 2000, 1990 ... ? <br>
	The famous <em>Stamperija</em> started to overflow the philatelic market from 2011, 
	but it is not the first company who tried to make revenue from collectors. 
    <em>Impressor</em> is another example - they were active in the 1990s and 2000s. <br>
	 Should you stop in 1990? 
	 But then you will have almost no dinosaur stamp in your collection, 
	 because the "dino-mania" started after release of the Jurassic Park movie 
	 of Steven Spielberg in 1993 and even then, your collection will include 
	 some stamps, such as "Animals" set of Fujeira 1972, which collectors 
	 who don't try to be "complete" might exclude. <br>

    <br>
	In my opinion, “your collection has to be complete” argument was invented by sellers who want to sell 
	you the stuff you might not buy otherwise. 
	I don’t buy the argument and skip the stuff I don’t like. 
	I collect for myself and don’t let anybody else force me to buy one or another stamp or cover.
	To me, my collection is a “Natural History Museum in Stock Books”. <br>
	Any museum in the world cannot buy every relevant object related to its collection, 
	instead they try to select the most interesting items that their visitors 
	will enjoy. <br>

	<em><strong>I do collect stamps and covers issued by any country anytime, but follow 
	<a href="../images/checklist_stamps.html">the checklist</a> I prepared</strong></em>. <br>
	There are many philatelic items which make no sense to me, 
	I marked as “<a href="../legend.html#unrec">undesired</a>”.

<br>
<a name="qa6"></a>
<h3>What are desired and undesired stamps to you?</h3>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0;">
	<em>Desired are stamps and covers with some background story.</em> <br>
	When I get a new item for my collection, I scan it in high resolution, 
	usually 600dpi, to inspect every detail on a big display. 
	Beside the technical details I try to find a story about the object(s) depicted 
	there. <br> 
    Results of my study end up in <a href="../description/stamps/index.html">articles</a> 
	published on this website and in the 
	<a href="publications.html">philatelic magazines</a>. <br>
	<br>
	<a href="../country/index.html">Stamps of the countries who depicted dinosaurs</a>, 
	for example, not discovered there, not stored in any museum in the country are 
	good candidates for my <a href="../legend.html#unrec">“undesired” list</a>. 
	The same is true for the stamps that depict prehistoric animals in too inaccurate or 
	abstract style. <br>

    The stamps with the mix of objects totally unrelated one to another: 
	Charles Darwin and dinosaurs for example. <br>

	Only a few dinosaurs were named prior to the date Darwin published 
	“<em>The Origin of Species</em>”, in 1859 
	(the first dinosaur was described in 1824 and the word “dinosaur” was coined in 1842).  
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px;">	
	In Darwin's time dinosaurs were seen as gigantic beasts that seemed to have little 
	connection to earlier or later types of animals, therefore they didn’t contribute 
	to Darwin’s work on his evolution theory.

<h3>How do you store your covers and postcards?</h3>
<p>
	In the beginning I purchased dedicated albums for cover collectors, 
	produced by Deutsche Post. 
	They are good, but expensive and occupy too much space on the shelf. <br>
	I keep the albums I have for the most valuable covers, the rest of the covers 
	I store in shoe or office boxes. 
	Every cover in the box is stored in a separate transparent plastic sleeve, 
	produced by one of the major philatelic accessories production companies. 
	When there is nothing special on the reverse side, I place two covers 
	(back-to-back) in the sleeve.
</p>


<br>
<br>
<a name="qa9"></a>
<h3>Where do you get information about stamps and covers related to your topic?</h3>
<p>
	Lucky collectors of a single country or region, may purchase one volume printed or 
	online catalogue, produced by the local 
	<a href="../links_postal_resources.html">Postal Authority</a> or one of the major stamp 
	catalogues production companies, MICHEL or Scott for example.<br>
	For topical collectors it can be challenging, because many if not all countries 
	of the world might have produced some stamps or covers related to their topics. <br>
	<br>
	Topical catalogues can be a good solution, but not many of them exist on the market 
	and they are not updated very often. <br>
	For example, in 2019 MICHEL printed "<em>Dinos - Ganze Welt</em>" - 160 A5 pages with 
	approx. 2.500 colour illustrations and about 20.000 price quotations for 
	prehistoric animals’ stamps, mainly dinosaurs. 
	If you collect dinosaur stamps – lucky you, even though over 50 stamp sets 
	published prior to the date of the catalogue are not listed!
	No update has been printed in the five years since. 
	A similar catalogue prior to the issue of “<em>Dinos - Ganze Welt</em>”, was printed by 
	the Spanish company Domphil in 2002. <br>

	Some philatelic literature related to "Paleophilatelie" topics: MICHEL's and Dompil's catalogues

	<br>  
	  
    <br>
	To generate a list of all existing stamps of a topic, requires searching through 
	world-wide stamp catalogs. Several companies offer such catalogs, in both print and 
	online versions, but they may cost several hundred Euros per annum.
	And creating such a list is a time-consuming and intensive task. <br>


	Colnect and StampWorld can be a good free alternative. <br>
	The problem with searching through world-wide catalogues, is you have to know what 
	to search for. 
	Some dinosaur stamps, for example, might not appear in the search results until 
	you search for the species name, because some stamps might have the title 
	“<a href="../images/sets/bosnia_herzegovina_2007.jpg"><em>Stegosaurus</em></a>” for example and the catalogue administrator listed it as is 
	without assigning it to dinosaurs’ category. <br>

	Another challenge is to get information about brand-new and coming issues. <br>
    <br>
	To get information about coming issues, I search through stamp issue plans of 
	<a href="../links_postal_resources.html">Postal Authorities</a> around the world 
	at the beginning of the year. 
	Many of them publish their plans on the Internet. 
	I also get information from international members of my Facebook group, 
    <a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/paleophilately"><strong>Paleophilately</strong></a>
	about the upcoming issues in their countries. <br>
	<em>

	<br>

    <br>
	Study Units of major Philatelic Associations can be of help. <br>
	The <strong>“<a target="_blank" href="https://biophilately.org/wordpress/">Biology Study Unit</a>”</strong>  
	of the American Topical Association publishes 
	“Biophilately” magazine every three months with the lists of all new stamps

	to the board of directors. <br>

<h3>How do you get your collectible objects?</h3>
<p>
	There are many options to obtain stamps and other philatelic items. <br>
	You can buy them directly in the post offices or philatelic desks, 
	philatelic shops, from stamp dealers or from other collectors either in 
	offline or online stores. 
	You can also swap your duplicates with other collectors. <br>

	Since I was a child I enjoyed swapping my duplicates with other kids. <br>
	The swap connects you with other collectors and sometimes allows you to 
	get the stuff you cannot get in your country or save a lot of money.	
	Later you might even develop friendship with some of them 
	to help each other over their lifetimes.

<p>
	Traditionally, stamp collectors organize clubs and societies who organize 
	regular meetings including swap sessions. <br>
	With the development of the Internet, the process for searching for a swap partner 
	became much easier. 
	There are several philatelic forums which include swap threads. 
	Collectors platforms such Colnect can be used to find the swap partners too. 
	TradeOnlyStamps is the website to search for swap partners, but its capability 
	is very limited. 
<br>	

<br>
	My favourite swap partner search internet resource is <strong>Facebook</strong>. <br> 
	Facebook has many public and private groups covering every topic you can imagine, 
	such as politics, travel, cooking, and even philatelic topics. 
	There are several “stamp swap” groups, groups for “cover collectors” etc.  
	The good thing is you can chat with international collectors online. 
	In case of the language barrier 
	<a target="_blank" href="https://translate.google.com">Google-Translator</a> or similar tool can help. <br>
	<br>
	There are two Facebook groups related to the topic of this website:
	"<a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/paleophilately"><strong>Paleophilately</strong></a>", 
	created and run by myself, and 
	"<a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/652830244799152"><strong>Evolution of mankind and Philately</strong></a>".

<h3>Where do you buy your stamps and covers?</h3>
<p>
	I use all the possibilities. <br>
	I try to buy brand new stamps directly from the post offices or their 
	<a target="_blank"  href="../links_postal_resources.html">philatelic bureaus</a>, 
	either offline or online. 
	Many Postal Authorities in the world have online shops where they offer their 
	stamps and other philatelic items. 
	This is the cheapest option to purchase brand-new stuff. <br>
	One or two times a year I visit stamp trade shows. 
	Several Postal Administrations of the neighbouring countries have their booths 
	where they sell their philatelic products at a nominal price.  <br>
	Old stamps, covers and postcards can be purchased from dealers. 
	Many of them have special prices. <br>
	Once I found a big box of covers with fossils and prehistoric animal stamps 
	for €1 each – I bought a lot, part for my own collection, part to swap or 
	give as a gift to friends. <br>
	<br>
	Philatelic stores are also an option, but in the last 10-15 years many of them 
	have closed. 
	All philatelic stores in Munich, where I live, moved out of the downtown area. 
	Some of them closed completely, others rented small rooms in the shopping malls 
	or elsewhere and sell their stuff mostly on the Internet. 
	The philatelic desk of Deutsche Post has moved from downtown and is now much 
	smaller than before. 
	The good thing is, it is easy to find the parking area nearby. <br>
	<br>
	Today, the Internet is the best option to buy collectible stuff and find 
	swap partners. <br>
	One additional benefit to ordering online (or in the old days from catalogs) 
	is that sellers tend to use interesting stamps (and sometimes a lot of them!) 
	on the package when they send you your item. 
	And it can be a good way to get used examples of stamps you collect or get stamps 
	that can be traded or given to your swap partners and friends. 
	This is especially true of international dealers - some of whom take care to 
	create nice covers 
	(Probably to entice sales but also as an understanding of the importance of stamps).
    <br>

	<br>
	<em>For more details about how to buy stamps on the Internet please read 
	“<a href="how_to_collect.html"><em>How to collect stamps in the XXI century</em></a>” 
	article.</em>	
    <br>

    <br>
	 Sometimes I even ask the seller to use a particular stamp on the cover for me.
	 When it works, I might get an additional nice cover for my collection or for swap.
	 When I have been informed in advance about the coming issue, I try to find a swap partner 
	 or even a seller in the country of the issue to ask to make me an addressed FDC and 
	 nice circulated covers.<br>

<h3>Is it expensive to collect stamps?</h3>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0;">
	Some stamps are expensive. <br>
	Once I saw <a href="../images/year/1840/penny_black_offers.jpg">an offer</a> 
	of a block of four “Penny Black”  
	(the first stamp in the world issued in Great Britain in <a href="1840s.html#penny">1840</a>)
	stamps for GBP 75.000 – most of us will probably prefer to spend the money to 
	buy a new car or even two. <br>
	<a href="../images/year/1840/penny_black_pl2_qk_card2.jpg">Fine used stamp of "Penny Black"</a>
	can be purchased for much more affordable price of one hundred Euro or even less.
	The good of Philately - there are always a possibility to find something you like 
	at reasonable price.

	Most  <a href="../images/checklist_stamps.html">“Paleophilatelie” related stamps</a> 
	are much cheaper and can be purchased at a reasonable 
	price between €1 and €20. <br>
	<br>
	For example: 
	<ul>
		<li>
			The set of two stamps "<a href="../images/sets/switzerland_2024.jpg">Giants of the Ice Age</a>" 
			issued by the Swiss Post in <a href="../year/2024.html">2024</a> was CHF 2.20 (approx. €2.34).</li>
		<li>
			The set of 8 stamps “<a href="../description/stamps/uk_2024_1.html">The Age of the Dinosaurs</a>” 
			issued by the Royal Mail of Great Britain in <a href="../year/2024.html">2024</a>, was sold for GBP 14.60 
			(approx. €17.4).</li>

		<li>
			The first stamp with reconstruction of prehistoric animals - 
			"<a href="../description/stamps/india_1951.html">Centenary of Geological Survey of India</a>" 
			from <a href="../year/195x.html">1951</a>, can be found for €3-€4 in mint (clean) condition, 
			the cancelled (CTO) stamp can be found for €2 or even less.
		</li>

<h3>How many stamps do you buy at the same time?</h3>
<p>
	I do buy several stamp sets almost every month. <br>
	First, I try to buy the brand-new stamps at the time they were issued. <br>
	Many <a href="../links_postal_resources.html">Postal Authorities</a> 
	withdraw stamps from their stores in a year or two from the issue date.
	Later you will need to pay more to purchase them from dealers. 
	Sometimes, exclusive or limited-edition philatelic products are offered 
	by the Postal Authorities when the stamps were issued. 
	It can be very expensive and difficult to find them after they are sold out.  <br>
	When no new stamps are available I buy older stamps, mostly on the Internet.  <br>
	<em>I prefer to purchase stamps regularly, rather than buy entire collections 
	or big stock at the same time.</em>
	I like to study every stamp at the time it arrives. <br>

	To purchase an entire collection from somebody who stopped collecting or 
	inherited it, can be good for the rich beginners. 
	I prefer to build my collection from scratch.

<h3>Is it not dangerous to buy and swap stamps and covers on the Internet?</h3>
<p>
	Well, the risk is there. 
	<em>Whatever you do on the Internet you have to be careful.</em>  <br>
	<br>
	There are always some cheaters mixed with the many serious users.
	Most of the trading platforms allow you to rate the partner at the end of 
	the transaction. 
	Check the rating of your partner and read the feedback left by other users, 
	before press on “buy” or “bid” button. <br>
	Facebook doesn’t have a rating system, but there are several “swap cheater” 
	groups where users report about the issues they faced and ask one another about 
	their experience with swap of a specific person. 
	When you buy anything on the Internet, including stamps, check the rating of 
	the seller, read the rules of the platform and sales conditions of the seller. <br>
	Use payment methods such as PayPal that offers buyer warranties. 
	This protects the buyer by returning the money either fully or partially if 
	the item is not received or is received in a condition different from described 
	by the seller.
