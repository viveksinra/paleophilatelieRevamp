	<strong>
		The study of fossil vertebrates: animals with a backbone. <br>
	</strong>
	<em>Vertebrates</em> are members of the <em>Phylum Chordata</em>.  <br>
    <em>Chordates</em> have a dorsal nerve cord protected by a notochord.  <br>
	A <em>notochord</em> is a stiff rod of cartilage that protects the dorsal nerve cord; 
	in vertebrates this structure has evolved into the vertebral column that protects the spinal cord.  <br>
	<u>Note:</u> the phylum chordata does include invertebrates – the tunicates (sea squirts) and 
				 cephalochordates (the lancelets).

<a name="tetrapods"></a>
<em>Tetrapods</em> are animals with four limbs and are derived from an ancestral <em>sarcopterygian fish</em>. <br>
Most amphibians have permeable skin, though modern <em>Caecilians</em> do have some scales. 
Their eggs are gelatinous. 
The permeable skin and gelatinous eggs restrict amphibians to moist environments. <br>
Many modern amphibians undergo metamorphosis, a transformation from a usually aquatic, fish-like larva to an adult. 
Modern Amphibians include frogs, salamanders and caecilians evolved in the early Mesozoic. 
There is also a variety of early stem tetrapods (transitional species between sarcopterygian fish and amphibians) and early Amphibians from the Paleozoic.<br>

<h2>Birds</h2>
 <strong>Birds</strong> or <strong>Avian Dinosaurs</strong> are closely related to the Theropod Dinosaurs. <br>
 Their anatomy is characterized by adaptations for flight, including the modification of the front limbs into the bones supporting the wings, 
 a strongly keeled sternum, and a coating of feathers. 
 <em>Feathers</em> likely developed in a manner similar to the development of fur in mammals – initially as invaginations of the epidermis 
 that developed filaments, followed by the development of barbing that interlocked adjacent filaments. <br>
 The keeled sternum provides a large surface area that the muscles that power flight attach to – the muscles then extend to the shoulder and upper arm. <br>
 Birds also exhibit a reduced and fused tail bone, the pygostyle. <br>

<h2>Fishes</h2>
<strong>Fishes</strong> are aquatic animals that live in marine or freshwater environments. <br>
They “breathe” using <em>gills</em> that absorb oxygen from water. 
Fish are divided into 5 major classes – Agnatha, Placodermi, Chondrichthyes, Acanthodia and Osteoichthyes. 
<ul>
	<li style="margin-top:10px; ">
		<strong>Agnathan</strong> fish today include the lamprey eels and hagfish found primarily in marine waters. <br>
		Agnathan fish have worm-like bodies.  <br>
		Their mouths are fixed open as they are jawless fish.  <br>
		The Agnatha first appeared in the Cambrian.  <br>
		Most Agnathan fish do not have paired sets of fins – a unifying characteristic for all other classes of fish.
	</li>

  <li style="margin-top:10px; ">
	    <strong>Placoderm</strong> fish have articulated jaws – so they could open and close their mouths. <br>
		<em>Placo</em> refers to plates and <em>derm</em> to skin – so these fishes have massively armored plates that cover the front half of the body.  
		The rest of the body was covered with small scales. <br>
		Placoderms are found in Silurian and Devonian aged rocks, but died out by the end of the Devonian. 
		<em>Bothriolepsis</em>, a placoderm fish, is found on a <a href="../../../description/stamps/latvia_2015.html">stamp from Latvia</a>. 
	</li>

  <li style="margin-top:10px; ">
		The <strong>Chondrichthyean</strong> fish include sharks and their relatives. <br>
		Their skeletons are made up primarily with cartilage with a few ossified elements including teeth and sometimes the vertebrae. <br>
		Sharks likely evolved during the Ordovician, but conclusive fossil evidence show that they were present in Silurian seas. 
	</li>

  <li style="margin-top:10px; ">
	    <strong>Acanthodians</strong> are sometimes classified as a subclass within the Osteoichthyes – as they do have bony struts that support the fins. <br>
		The rest of the Acanthodian skeleton is made up of cartilage.<br>
		 Acanthodian fish are found in Silurian to Permian-aged rocks and died out in the terminal Permian Mass Extinction Event. 
	</li>

  <li style="margin-top:10px; ">
 	    <strong>Osteoichthyean</strong> fish have mineralized skeletons of bone composed of apatite. <br>
		 The Class Osteoichthyes is split into 2 major groups – both with extant members. <br>
		 <ul>
			<li> 
				The <em>Actinopterygii</em> are commonly referred to as “ray-finned fishes” as their fins are supported by a series of small bony struts. <br>
				The far majority of fish living today belong to the Actinopterygii and include fish like the goldfish.  <br>
				This group first appears in the early Silurian and become the dominant group of fish in the Triassic.  <br>
			</li>
			<li>
				The <em>Sarcopterygii</em> have two sets of fins that articulate with the main skeleton through a pectoral (shoulder) and a pelvic (hip) girdle.  <br>
				The bones that make up the fins consist of a series of bones that are homologous to the bones of the limbs of tetrapods.  <br>
				Sarcopterygian fish are commonly referred to as the lobe-finned fish.  <br>
				Sarcopterygian fish include the modern lungfish (fish that are capable of briefly living on land – with 4 modern species found in Africa, South America and Australia) and the coelacanths.  <br>
				Coelacanths were rediscovered in the early 20<sup>th</sup> century as living animals – they had been thought to be extinct.  <br>
				Modern Coelacanths are found off the coast of western Africa from South Africa to Kenya as well as in the vicinity of Madagascar and the Comoros Islands.  <br>
				A second population has been found in the waters of Indonesia north of the island of Sulawesi.  <br>
				Sarcopterygian fish first appear in the Silurian and are closely related to the Tetrapods.

<h2>Mammals</h2>
<strong>Mammals</strong> are characterized by bearing hair – where the development of hair follicles likely followed 
a similar pathway to the evolution of filamentous feathers in dinosaurs and birds. <br>
Mammals are members of the <em>amniota</em> – <strong>amniotes</strong> are vertebrates that lay or had ancestors that laid 
hard-shelled eggs with internal sacs that supplied the embryo with nutrients and stored waste products. <br>
Reptiles and Birds are also amniotes. <br>
<em>Monotremes</em> are the only living mammals that lay eggs – they include the Duck-billed <em>Platypus</em> and several species of 
<em>Echidna</em> that are limited to <a href="../../../country/australia.html">Australia</a> and <a href="../../../country/australia.html">New Guinea</a>.<br> 
The other modern branches of the Mammalia, Marsupials and Placentals both give live-birth. <br>
<em>Marsupials</em> are only found on Australia and the Americas and include animals like the kangaroo, koala and opossum. <br>
<em>Placental</em> mammals are the dominant group today and include everything from Mice to Humans. <br>
Mammals had greater diversity in the Mesozoic as there are several extinct lineages known from the fossil record. <br>
The majority of these fossil mammals are known from teeth or jaw fragments as Mammals have distinctive teeth.  <br>
Female mammals feed their young with secretions of milk from their mammary glands. <br>
<em>Mammals are derived from synapsid reptiles</em>. <br> 
The <strong>synapsids</strong> that are more closely related to mammals exhibited teeth differentiation with the development of canines, incisors, and molars. 
This trait was passed on to their mammalian descendants – and the shape and number of incisors, canines, premolars and molars is often diagnostic when identifying specific species of mammals.<br>

<h2>Reptiles</h2>
<strong>Reptiles</strong> are amniotes with scaley skin. <br>
Historically, reptiles have been classified into 4 major groups based on the number and presence of temporal fenestrae. <br>
Unlike amphibians, Reptiles do not exhibit a larval stage or metamorphosis. 
Most reptiles lay eggs, though a few reptiles evolved to give live birth – including some of the extinct aquatic reptiles like <a href="ichthyosaur.html">Ichthyosaurs</a>.<br> 
Both scaley skin and the amniotic egg were adaptations that allowed reptiles to exploit drier terrestrial environments away from shore. 
Temporal fenestrae are openings in the skull behind the eye socket (orbit). 
The four groups include anapsids (parareptiles, turtles and tortoises) with no temporal fenestrae, synapsids (mammal-like reptiles) with one temporal fenestra, 
diapsids (most modern reptiles and many extinct groups; major groups include snakes and lizards, crocodiles, pterosaurs and dinosaurs) with two temporal fenestrae, 
and euryapsids (ichthyosaurs and plesiosaurs) which had one temporal fenestrae but evolved from diapsid ancestors who secondarily lost the lower temporal fenestrae. <br>
More recent work has shown that turtles and tortoises are highly derived diapsid reptiles that secondarily lost both temporal fenestrae. <br>

		Synapsids are a group of animals that includes mammals, mammal-like reptiles and every animal more closely related to mammals.
		Unlike Euryapsids, they have a temporal fenestra, an opening behind the orbit, low in the skull roof behind each eye, 
		leaving a bony arch beneath each.
