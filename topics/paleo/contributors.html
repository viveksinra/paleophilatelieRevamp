  Georg Bauer, better known by the Latin version of his name Georgius Agricola, is considered the founder of geology as
  a discipline. <br>
  His work paved the way for further systematic study of the Earth and of its rocks, minerals, and fossils. <br>
  In 1544, he published the <em>De ortu et causis subterraneorum</em>,
  in which he laid the first foundations of a physical geology, and criticized the theories of the ancients. <br>
  However, he maintained that a certain 'materia pinguis' or 'fatty matter,' set into fermentation by heat, gave birth to 
  <strong>fossil organic shapes</strong>, as opposed to fossil shells having belonged to living animals. <br>
   In 1545, he followed with the <em>De natura eorum quae effluunt e terra</em>; 
    in 1546 the <em>De veteribus et novis metallis</em>, a comprehensive account of the discovery and occurrence of 
    minerals and also more commonly known  as <em>De Natura Fossilium</em>; 
    in 1548, the <em>De animantibus subterraneis</em>; and in the two following years a
  number of smaller works on the metals.

  <strong>Mary Anning</strong> (21 May 1799 – 9 March 1847) was an English fossil collector and dealer
  who became known around the world for important finds she made in  Jurassic marine fossil beds in the cliffs along the English Channel at
  Lyme Regis, now part of what is now called the Jurassic Coast, in the county of Dorset in Southwest England. <br>
  Her findings contributed to important changes in scientific thinking about prehistoric life and the history of the Earth.<br>
  Anning searched for fossils in the area's Blue Lias cliffs, particularly during the winter months when landslides
  exposed new fossils that had to be collected quickly before they were lost to the sea. <br>
  Her discoveries included the first <a href="./vertebrate/ichthyosaur.html">Ichthyosaur</a>
  skeleton correctly identified; the first two more complete <strong>Plesiosaur</strong> skeletons
  found; the first pterosaur skeleton located outside Germany; and important fish fossils. <br>
  Her observations played a key role in the discovery that coprolites, known as bezoar stones at the time, were fossilised faeces. <br>
  She also discovered that belemnite fossils contained fossilised ink sacs like those of modern cephalopods. <br>
  Her discoveries inspired famous geologist (and childhood friend) Henry De la Beche to paint 'Duria Antiquior - A More Ancient Dorset' in 1830. <br>
  He sold prints to raise money for Mary, who was still struggling to make ends meet. <br>
  Duria Antiquior - complete with ichthyosaur, plesiosaur and pterosaur - is the very first pictoral representation of prehistoric life based 
  on fossil evidence. <br>
  Today the Natural History Museum in London showcases several of Mary Anning's spectacular finds, including her ichthyosaur, plesiosaur and pterosaur. <br>
  Much like they did two centuries ago, her fossils continue to captivate visitors from around the world.

He was a pioneer in the study of national folklore and is considered the initiator of scientific archeology in Argentina. 
He founded and fully organized the Ethnographic Museum, found prehistoric cities such as La Paya, in Salta. <br>
<br>
In 1890 he published "Observations on the <strong>Oligocene fossil reptiles</strong> of the Tertiary lands of the ancient Paraná"
(original name: “Observaciones sobre los reptiles fósiles oligocenos de los terrenos terciarios antiguos del Paraná” )
in the bulletin of the National Academy of Sciences of Córdoba. 
In this article he described some fossils from collection of 
Entre Ríos Museum in Paraná City, such as prehistoric lizard <em>Propodinema</em> from late Miocene (9.0 - 6.8 million year ago) 
(nowadays <em>Propodinema</em> is a synonym of <em>Tupinambis</em>). Some prehistoric crocodiles of genus <em>Oxysdonsaurus</em>
and <em>Proalligator</em>.<br>
Ambrosetti published a second article a few years later in the bulletin of the Argentinian Geographic Institute.
“Contributions to the study of <strong>Oligocene fluvial tortoises</strong> in the old tertiary land in the Paraná”
(original name: “Contribución al estudio de las tortugas fluviales oligocenas de los terrenos terciarios antiguos del Paraná”).
In this article he described some prehistoric tortoises of <em>Platemys</em> genus from collection of Parana Museum.

  <strong>Grigores Antipa</strong> (1861-1944) was
  the zoologist, ichthyologist, Hydrobiology, economist, ecologist,
  oceanology, museology. <br>
  He founded the Romanian school of Hydrobiology, ichthyology and oceanology, pioneer in the field of museology, the
  author of modern concepts in ecology, biosociologiei, biosphere. <br>
  He was director of the Museum of Natural History in Bucharest, where he
  had an important contribution to the organization on a phylogenetic and ecological collections. <br>
  As a token of gratitude for his work in the museum since 1933, Museum of Natural History bears his name. <br>
  Some web sites or even catalogues mentioned this stamp as stamp of first paleontologist, but it is wrong. <br>
  The missleading is caused by fossil of <em>Dinotherium giganteum</em> depicting on a background of the stamp. <br>
  It is there just because it is the most impressive artifact of the museum.

  He was a member of the Russian Academy of Sciences, a co-founder of the Russian Geographical Society, 
  and the first president of the Russian Entomological Society, making him a distinguished Baltic German scientist.
  <br>
  
  <p>
  When the first fully preserved skeleton of a <strong><a href="vertebrate/mammoth.html">woolly mammoth</a></strong> brought to St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences
  by Michael Adams in 1806.
  <p><em>
    <strong>The Adams mammoth</strong> is the first <a href="vertebrate/mammoth.html">woolly mammoth</a> skeleton with skin and flesh still attached to be recovered by scientists.<br> 
   The mostly complete skeleton and flesh were discovered in 1799 in northeastern Siberia by Ossip Shumachov, 
   an Evenki hunter and subsequently recovered in 1806 when Russian botanist Mikhail Adams journeyed to the location and collected the remains.
  </em></p>
  The mammoth and its excellent preservation became central to research made into aspects of permafrost and of the Ice Age, 
  started in Russia by Karl Ernst von Baer.
  <br>
  It was Baer’s guess that mammoth corpses could survive for several thousands of years but only in permafrost. 
  <br>
  Adams’s report on the conditions of the site where the mammoth was found was contradictory. 
  Baer was unable to understand how the mammoth came to be there. 
  He thought that there were three possibilities: it was located on an iceberg, 
  it was in ice heaped up on the shore of a river, or it had melted from an ice-wall covered with soil.

  To clarify it, he organized an expedition to Siberia, headed by <strong>Alexander Theodor von Middendorff</strong> that 
  took place between 1842 and 1845.
  One of the most important questions to be answered by Middendorff’s expedition, according to Baer, was to fix as
  exactly as possible the physico-geographic and geologic conditions at the site at which Adams’ mammoth had been
  found, Cape Bykovski in Siberia.<br>
  Unfortunately, Middendorff was unable to find any new information about Adam's Mammoth, as to much time had passed since it was found in 1799. 
  However, he discovered and described  remnants of another mammoth on the Taymyr peninsula (at Nizhnaya-Taymyr River). <br>
  At the end of the 1850s, he began to analyse the material he had collected. He compiled an
  historical review of all similar ﬁnds in Siberia concluding that, in the past, mammoths had lived in the central
  and southern regions of Siberia, in climatic conditions quite similar to those of his time.
  <br>
  
  In 1866 Baer publish an article
  "Neue Auffindung eines vollständiges Mammuts, mit der Haut und den Weichtheilen, im Eisboden Sibiriens, in den Nähe der Bucht des Tas"
   (New discovery of a complete mammoth, with its skin and soft parts, in the ice floor of Siberia, near the Bay of the Tas)
  about the Mammoth, discovered by another Baltic German scientist Carl Friedrich Schmidt.
  <p>
    <strong>Carl Friedrich Schmidt</strong>, sometimes called just Friedrich Schmidt  (1832-1908) was a geologist and botanist 
    in the Russian Empire and also known as the founder of Estonian geology, who described the stratigraphy and fauna of 
    Lower Paleozoic rocks in Estonia and neighboring areas.<br>
    In 1859-1866 Schmidt participated in several expeditions in Siberia.<br>
    In 1866 he guided an expedition of the Russian Science Academy to Siberia to describe and collect Mammoth remains, discovered at Enisej river.
    In 1869 he described his discovery of the Mammoth in the article "Mittheilungen über die wissenschaftlichen Resultate der Expedition zur
    Aufsuchung eines angekündigten Mammuthcadavers" (Report about the scientific results of the expedition to Search for an announced mammoth cadaver)

  <strong>Georges-Louis  Leclerc, Comte de Buffon</strong> (1707-1788) 
  He envisioned the nature of science and understood the roles of paleontology, zoological geography, and animal psychology. <br>
  He realized both the necessity of transformism and its difficulties. <br>
  Although his cosmogony was inadequate and his theory of animal reproduction was
  weak, and although he did not understand the problem of classification,  he did establish the intellectual framework within which most
  naturalists up to Darwin worked. <br>
  Buffon is considered the founder of evolutionary theory. 
  He was the first who mentioned that living species changed through time and who found some
  similarities between humans and apps, rhen suggested they might have a common ancestor. <br>
  George Buffon set   forth his general views on species classification in the first volume
  of his "Histoire Naturelle". <br>
  Buffon objected to the so-called "artificial" classifications of Andrea Cesalpino and Carolus Linnaeus, 
  stating that in nature the chain of life has small gradations from one type to another and that the
  discontinuous categories are all artificially constructed by mankind.

<br><a name="burian"></a> 
  <strong>Zdenek Burian</strong> (1905-1981) was a Czech painter and book illustrator whose work played a
  central role in the development of palaeontological reconstructions during a remarkable career spanning five decades. <br>
  Originally recognised only in his native Czechoslovakia, Burian's fame later spread to an international audience, 
  and a number of artists later attempted to emulate his style. <br>
  He is regarded by many as the most influential palaeo-artist of the modern era. <br>

    title="Zdenek Burian" 
    alt="Zdenek Burian"
    src="../../images/thematic/persons/burian_zdenek.jpg"></a>


  Burian was an extremely prolific artist whose works are estimated to number between 15,000 and 20,000 paintings and drawings (pen and pencil). 
  He illustrated over 500 books (including natural history subjects and numerous classic novels such as Robinson Crusoe, Tarzan, Plutonia)
  and some 600 book covers, but it is within the fields of palaeontology  and palaeoanthropology that Burian's influence has been most notable. <br>
  Since the late 1950s and early 1960s when Burian's work became known in the west through a series of large-format books released by the Artia
  publishing house, numerous scholarly and popular books on prehistoric life have featured his work, either as originals or as art based
  closely on them. <br>
  Burian worked in initial cooperation with university palaeontologist Josef Augusta from 1938/39 (during World War II all universities in
  Czechoslovakia were closed due to the German occupation) and subsequently (following Augusta's death in 1968) with Zdenek pinar,
  painting accurate and magnificent reconstructions representing all forms of prehistoric life from many parts of the globe, from the
  earliest invertebrates to a vast array of fish, amphibians, reptiles, mammals and birds, as well as panoramic vistas of the landscapes in
  which they lived. <br>
  Close to 500 prehistoric images were painted by him between the early 1930s and the late 1970s. <br>
  Whilst some of Burian's earliest palaeo works depicting North American species were inspired by the pioneering American palaeo-artist Charles R.
  Knight (see for example, his first renditions of Stegosaurus and Brontotherium), partly because Burian lacked access to skeletal
  material for such reconstructions, Burian's work was less stylised and more convincing with respect to both the subjects and their landscapes,
  and soon became highly regarded amongst palaeontologists, especially in Europe. <br>
  Previous palaeo-artists had often produced speculative works reflecting 19th century views of large dinosaurs as lethargic reptiles
  akin to giant lizards with sprawling limbs, but Burian convincingly painted them as active animals with parasagittal (mammal or bird-like)
  limb-movement and musculature.

  <strong>Charles Darwin</strong> (1809 -1882 )  was born in Shrewsbury, Shropshire in 12 February 1809,
  to a wealthy and well-connected family. <br>

  He had initially planned to study medicine at Edinburgh University but later switched to Divinity
  at Cambridge encouraged a passion for natural science. 
  His five-year voyage on HMS Beagle established him as an eminent geologist whose observations and theories supported Charles Lyell's uniformitarian
  ideas, and publication of his journal of the voyage made him famous as a popular author. <br>
  Puzzled by the geographical distribution of wildlife and fossils he collected on the voyage, Darwin investigated the
  transmutation of species and conceived his theory of natural selection in 1838. <br>
  Although he discussed his ideas with several naturalists, he needed time for extensive research and his geological work had
  priority. He was writing up his theory in 1858 when Alfred Russel Wallace sent him an essay which described the same idea, prompting
  immediate joint publication of both of their theories. <br>
  His 1859 book On the Origin of Species established evolutionary descent with modification as the dominant scientific
  explanation of diversification in nature. <br>
  He examined human evolution and sexual selection in The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation  to Sex, followed 
  by The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals. <br>
  His research on plants was published in a series of books, and in his final book, he examined earthworms and their effect on soil. <br>
  The fact that evolution occurs became accepted by the scientific community and much of the general public in his lifetime, while his
  theory of natural selection came to be widely seen as the primary explanation of the process of evolution in the 1930s, and now forms the
  basis of modern evolutionary theory. <br>
  In modified form, Darwin's scientific discovery is the unifying theory of the life sciences,
  providing logical explanation for the diversity of life. <br>
  In recognition of Darwin's pre-eminence, he was one of only five 19<sup>th</sup> century UK non-royal personages to be honoured by a state funeral,
  and was buried in Westminster Abbey, close to John Herschel and Isaac Newton. <br>
  Darwin's work had far-reaching impacts on the development of Paleontology,
  Antropology and many other Biology and Psyology related scients.

Domeyko was not particularly interested in paleontology but found fossils during his work.<br> 
He occasionally sent these fossils to French Naturalists for study. <br>
These fossils were mainly studied by Alcide Charles Victor Marie Dessalines d’Orbigny who named some 
of these fossils after their discoverer. <br>
For example, d”Orbigny named fossil species Nautilus domeykus and Ammonites domeykanus among others. 
These fossils are either on exhibit or archived at the Museum of Natural History in Paris together 
with d’Orbigny’s notes.

  After reading Darwin's Origin of Species, Huxley reaction was: "How stupid of

  Was a self-educated intellectual giant of the 19th century, a
  pioneering genius whose influence was felt throughout the science,
  education, and politics of Victorian England. <br>
  His brilliant career ranged from surgeon's apprentice to England's Privy Council, service on
  10 royal commissions, and president of the Royal Society from 1881 to 1885. <br>
  His many awards included the Royal, Copley, and Darwin medals.
  A man of astonishing energy and prodigious talent, Huxley had a sharp wit and a brilliant, questioning mind 
  (traits no doubt passed on to his grandsons, including novelist Aldous Huxley).
  He invented the term "agnostic" to describe his own religious view, and the term's widespread, immediate acceptance freed
  intellectual discourse from the belief-versus-disbelief straightjacket, in and out of theistic contexts. <br>
  And yet while he was never one to sacrifice principle for propriety, he vigorously defended his ideas but always treated his
  opponents with respect and sometimes-astonishing courtesy. <br>
  Always a popularizer of science, he at once subscribed  to Charles Darwin's theories and proved to be their most indefatigable
  advocate. <br>
  The role earned him the title "Darwin's bulldog", and he is best remembered today for his prominent role in defending evolution
  against attacks from scientists, theists, and philosophers somewhat ironic, for Huxley's biological writings show less explicit 
  support for natural selection than for evolution itself.

  <strong>Thomas Jefferson</strong> (1743-1826) USA, was
  third President of the United States, as universally recognized as a man of science. <br>
  He was recognized as a pioneer in ethnology, geography, anthropology and our subject paleontology. <br>
  Because of his wide range of knowledge, Jefferson was ahead of his time in several lines of inquiry 
  and advanced of contemporary scientists. <br>
  Even so, Jefferson never failed to acknowledge that in science he was "an amateur.<br>

      src="../../images/thematic/persons/jefferson_thomas2.jpg"></a>
  
  "One of the first glimpses of Jefferson's interest in paleontology can be found in his Notes on the State of Virginia. <br>
  It is his most impressive scientific achievement, in which he recorded his observations of flora, fauna, mountains, rivers, climate, population,
  laws, politics, customs and fossils of his native state. <br>
  In Notes Jefferson, also, refuted the contentions of Count <a href="#buffon">de Buffon</a> that the animals common to both old world and new are smaller in the new. <br>
  One of the reasons Jefferson wrote and published Notes was to refute a claim by the eminent naturalist, the Comte de Buffon, that human and animal
  life in America was degenerative and therefore inferior to the life forms in Europe. <br>
  Buffon believed, Jefferson wrote in his Notes, "that nature is less active, less energetic on one side of the globe than she
  is on the other." <br>
  Jefferson added with more than a hint of sarcasm, "as if both sides were not warmed by the same genial sun," and launched
  into a lengthy refutation of Buffon's hypothesis with convincing evidence that animals are actually larger in America than in Europe. <br>
  The mastodon, or mammoth,was his clincher; Europe had produced no animal to match this behemoth ... his shipment of mastodon fossils to
  Paris, therefore, was not entirely Enlightenment altruism; it was also a final salvo in a scientific war. <br>
  Buffon's suggestion that infant America was nature's retardate drove him to collect the ancient bones  of the mammoth ... <br>
  When he received his fossils, he catalogued them carefully and precisely, as was his habit, sending them off to
  Philadelphia for admiration, and to Paris for edification. <br>
  He kept a few choice specimens, however, for his Monticello museum--trophies of a sort in commemoration of his private victory in the 
  battle of New World versus Old. (McLaughlin, 1988) he entry room at Monticello had been turned by Jefferson into 
  a Natural History Museum which showed his great interest in fossils. <br>
  Perhaps Jefferson's greatest contribution to paleontology is that while President he helped to make it a respectable pursuit and was 
  largely responsible through the American Philosophical Society for bringing together the materials necessary for its advancement. <br>
  As the first citizen of the young nation, Jefferson's passion brought prestige and respectability to the young science.

  <strong>Jean Baptiste Lamarck</strong> (1744 - 1829), France Jean-Baptiste Pierre Antoine
  de Monet, Chevalier de la Marck (1 August 1744, Bazentin, Somme - 18 December 1829), often just known
  as "Lamarck", was a French soldier, naturalist, academic and an early proponent of the idea that evolution occurred and proceeded in
  accordance with natural laws. <br>
  In the modern era, Lamarck is primarily remembered for a theory of inheritance of acquired characteristics, called soft
  inheritance or Lamarckism. <br>

  However, his idea of soft inheritance was, perhaps, a reflection of the folk wisdom of the time, accepted by many
  natural historians. <br>
  Lamarck's contribution to evolutionary theory consisted of the first truly cohesive theory of evolution, in which an
  alchemical complexifying force drove organisms up a ladder of complexity, and a second environmental force adapted them to local
  environments through use and disuse of characteristics, differentiating them from other organisms. <br>
  Lamarckism (or Lamarckian inheritance) is the idea that an organism can pass on characteristics that it acquired during its
  lifetime to its offspring (also known as heritability of acquired characteristics or soft inheritance).  <br>
  It is named after the French biologist Jean-Baptiste Lamarck (1744-1829), who incorporated the
  action of soft inheritance into his evolutionary theories. 
  He is often incorrectly cited as the founder of soft inheritance, which proposes that individual efforts during the lifetime of the
  organisms were the main mechanism driving species to adaptation, as they supposedly would acquire adaptive changes and pass them on to
  offspring. <br>
  After publication of <a href="#darwin">Charles Darwin</a>'s theory of natural selection, the importance of individual efforts in the generation of
  adaptation was considerably diminished. <br>
  Later, Mendelian genetics supplanted the notion of inheritance of acquired traits, eventually leading to the development of the modern evolutionary synthesis, and
  the general abandonment of the Lamarckian theory of evolution in biology. <br>
  Despite this abandonment, interest in Lamarckism has recently increased, as several studies in the field of epigenetics have
  highlighted the possible inheritance of behavioral traits acquired by the previous generation. <br>
  In a wider context, soft inheritance is of use when examining the evolution of cultures and ideas, and is related to the theory of memetics.

<p class="notes">
	Until the early 1800s all scientists in Europe believed in the Divine Creation of the Earth and its life. 
	It was a common belief, that God created the world and all that was on it.  
	All species were created by God for particular roles in Nature. 
	As the roles were fixed by the Creator from the beginning, there is no need for species to change. 
	An intensive study of nature started  in the second half of the 1700s, raised questions about life diversity 
	and the relationship between different species. <br>

	In the beginning of the 1800s some naturalists started to propose their theories about the development of life.
	Jean-Baptiste Pierre Antoine de Monet, chevalier de Lamarck (1744 –1829), often known simply as Lamarck,
	 was a French naturalist, biologist and academic. 
	He outlined his theories regarding evolution first in his Floreal lecture of 1800, 
	and then in three later published works. 
	Lamarck referred to a tendency for organisms to become more complex, moving "up" a ladder of progress. 
	He believed in the ongoing spontaneous generation of simple living organisms through action on physical 
	matter by a material life force. 
	He believed that all life was organized in a vertical chain, with gradation between the lowest 
	forms and the highest forms of life, thus demonstrating a path to progressive developments in nature. 
	According to Lamarck the environment gives rise to changes in animals. 
	He cited examples of blindness in moles, the presence of teeth in mammals and the absence of teeth 
	in birds as evidence of this principle.  <br>
	Lamarck was not the first thinker to advocate organic evolution, Erasmus Darwin, grandfather of Charles Darwin, 
	had praised general concepts of evolution and common descent in his Zoonomia (1794), 
	a poetic fantasy of gradual creation including undeveloped ideas anticipating concepts his grandson expanded. 
	However, Lamarck was the first to develop a truly coherent evolutionary theory, known as "Lamarckism".  <br>
    <br>
	Etienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire (1772 – 1844) a colleague of Lamarck expanded and defended Lamarck's 
	evolutionary theory. 
	Geoffroy believed in the underlying unity of organismal design, and the possibility of the transmutation of 
	species in time, amassing evidence for his claims through research in comparative anatomy, paleontology, and embryology. 
	Geoffroy said that he believed in a God, but also in a law-like universe, with no supernatural interference 
	in the details of existence. 
	In 1822, Geoffroy published Anatomical Philosophy, in which he highlighted puzzles in anatomy that lent weight 
	to the evolutionary ideas of Lamarck. 
	A powerful line of argument came from the study of the same structures of different animals.

	Lamarck’s and Geoffroy’s ideas that Nature was autonomous and could almost randomly generate higher

<strong>Carl Anton Larsen</strong> (1860 – 1924) was a Norwegian-born whaler, Antarctic explorer, 
and the pioneer of Antarctic whaling. <br>

  He was captain of the Jason on the Norwegian Whaling Exploration, 1892-1893, making a solitary 
  voyage to Antarctic waters from Sandefjord in search of opportunities for whaling.  <br>
  Landing on Seymour Island, he collected specimens of sedimentary rocks that included
  <strong>fossils of shells and petrified wood</strong>, 
  the first recovered from continental Antarctica for which he received the Back Grant from the 
  Royal Geographical Society. <br>

  <br><a name="nordenskjoeld"></a> 
  A decade later, in 1902, Swedish geologist Otto Nordenskjöld discovered Jurassic 
  plant fossils, also on Seymour Island. He became one of the first to suggest that Antarctica 
  must have experienced a much warmer climate in the past, covered by forests of ferns and tropical plants. <br>

A year later, in 1903, there was another find of plant fossils, this time on the other side of the continent, 
during <a href="#scott">Scott’s</a> first visit to Antarctica, the Discovery expedition. <br>
It was the geologist Hartley Ferrar who discovered fossilized plant remains in the upper Taylor Valley, 
one of the famous dry valleys west of McMurdo Sound.

  Since the beginning of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, geological and paleontological explorations on 
  Seymour Island have demonstrated that this island contains one of the most important records of 
  the Late Cretaceous and Paleogene life in the Southern Hemisphere.

Already at a young age, with help of his brother and support of his farther, he established "Moreno Museum". <br>
The museum was opened in house of his parents. 
Nowadays, many fossils of Moreno Museum can be seen in "<a href="museums.html#laplata">the Museum of La Plata</a>".<br>
In 1880, Moreno went to <a href="france.html">France</a>, where he spoke at a meeting of the
Anthropology Society of Paris, discussing two prehistoric skulls he had
unearthed in Río Negro territory.  <br>
He believed one was from the Quaternary period, and the other had ritual deformation in a manner
similar to the skulls of the Aymara people of the Andes and Altiplano. <br>
In 1888, he founded the <a href="museums.html#laplata">La Plata Museum of Natural History</a> (building of
the museum can be seen on many Argentine stamps), the most important of
its kind in South America, that houses 3 million fossils and relics.

Muniz worked as a physician at Lujan.  
Lujan was already a famous area due to the discovery of the immense ground sloth <em>Megatherium</em> in 1788. <br>
He developed a collection that he intended to be used to create a natural history museum.  <br>
He donated his artifacts (some sources say he was forced to donate them) to Juan Manuel de Rosas, who was a politician,
 army officer and who ruled Buenos Aires Province and briefly the Argentine Confederation at this time. <br>
<br>
Muniz stayed in contact with <strong>Charles Darwin</strong>, with whom he exchanged some letters and articles. <br>
It was Darwin who convinced Muniz in 1845, to send fossil of a sabertooth cat which Muniz described 
and named as <em>Muni-felus bonaerensis</em>, in Gaceta Mercantil (local newspaper) to Natural History Museum for 
investigation.  <br>
Experts of the museum ascribed the fossil to Smilodon bonaerensis species.

<br><a name="pallas"></a> 
<strong>Peter Simon Pallas</strong> (1741–1811), the outstanding naturalist of German origin, became a veteran and honourable member of the Sankt-Petersburg Academy of Sciences.
A part of his great activity was devoted to paleontological research on animals of the “mammoths fauna”.
During two long expeditions in the Russian Empire he recognized and described many fossils. Particularly, he was the first scientist, who received and described some remains of extinct animal with soft parts preserved in permafrost of Siberia. He introduced formal binomial nomenclature and Linnean taxonomy to Russia, and named many species including: Rhinoceros lenensis (rhino), Nautilites complanatus (early Cretaceous ammonite), Cardium trigonoides (subfossil bivalve), Eschara lapidosa (Miocene bryozoan).
It is accepted that, the Russian paleontological science on the permanent basis has originated from the works of Pallas.

<br><a name="peale"></a> 
  <strong>Charles Wilson Peale</strong> (1741-1827) USA
  was an American painter, soldier and naturalist. 
  He is best remembered for his portrait paintings of leading figures of the American Revolution,
  as well as establishing one of the first museums Peale
  had a great interest in natural history, and organized the first U.S.
  scientific expedition in 1801. <br>

  <a href="../../images/sets/usa_1955_peale.jpg"><img  hspace="4"

    title="Charles Wilson Peale" alt="Charles Wilson Peale"
    src="../../images/thematic/persons/peale.jpg"></a>

  These two major interests combined in his founding of what became the Philadelphia Museum, 
  and was later renamed the Peale Museum. <br>
  This museum is considered the first. 
  It housed a diverse collection of botanical, biological, and archaeological specimens. 
  Most notably, the museum contained a large variety of birds which Peale himself acquired,
  and it was the first to display North American mastodon bones (which in Peale's time were 
  referred to as mammoth bones; these common names were amended by Georges Cuvier in 1800, 
  and his proposed usage is that employed today) 
  display of the "mammoth" bones entered Peale into a long standing
  debate between <a href="#jefferson">Thomas Jefferson</a> and <a href="#buffon">Comte de Buffon</a>. <br>
  Buffon argued that Europe was superior to the Americas biologically, which was illustrated
  through the size of animals found there. <br>
  Jefferson referenced the existence of these "mammoths" (which he believed still roamed northern
  regions of the continent) as evidence for a greater biodiversity in  America. <br>
  Peale's display of these bones drew attention from Europe, as did his method of re-assembling large skeletal specimens in three
  dimension. <br>
  The museum was among the first to adopt Linnaean taxonomy. <br>
  This system drew a stark contrast between Peale's museum and his competitors who
  presented their artifacts as mysterious oddities of the natural world. <br>
  The museum underwent several moves during its existence. 
  At various times it was located in several prominent buildings including Independence
  Hall and the original home of the American Philosophical Society. <br>
  The museum would eventually fail, in large part because Peale was unsuccessful at obtaining government funding. <br>
  After his death, the museum was sold to, and split up by, showmen P. T. Barnum and Moses Kimball.

<br><a name="palissy"></a> 
  <strong>Bernard  Palissy</strong> (1510–1589) was a French Huguenot potter, hydraulics engineer 
  and craftsman, famous for having struggled for sixteen years to imitate Chinese porcelain.<br>

  title="Bernard Palissy" 
  style="width: 100px; height: 151px; float: left;" 
  alt="Bernard Palissy"
  src="../../images/country/france/bernard_palissy.jpg">

  In the 19<sup>th</sup> century, Palissy's pottery became the  inspiration for Mintons Ltd's Victorian 
  majolica, which was exhibited at the Great Exhibition of 1851 under the name "Palissy ware". <br>
  Palissy is known for his contributions to the natural sciences, and is famous for discovering principles 
  of geology, hydrology and <strong>fossil</strong> formation. <br>
  He was one of the first Europeans to enunciate the correct theory of the origin of fossils. <br>
  Palissy correctly maintained that fossils were the remains of once living organisms, and contested the
  prevailing view that they had been produced by the biblical flood, or by astrological influence. <br>
  He argued that minerals, dissolving into water to form "congelative water," would precipitate and 
  thereby petrify once living organisms in order to create fossils.

  Together with <a href="#antipa">Grigore Antipa</a>, he was one of the most noted promoters of natural
  sciences in Romania. <br>
  Racovita was the first Romanian to have gone on a scientific research expedition to the Antarctic, 
  more than 100 years ago, as well as an influential professor, scholar and researcher. <br>
  He found and described several fossils in caves he was observing, for example Ursilor Cave. <br>
  The cave was discovered in 1975. 
  The name of the cave originates from the numerous cave-bear fossils discovered here,
  being an appropriate shelter for animals for more than 15,000 years. <br>
  They believe that the cave entrance was blocked by a fallen rock so that more than 140 bears attacked 
  each other because of hunger. <br>
  In September 1975, a group of amateur speleologists from "Speodava" Club explored the cave for the 
  first time and 5 years later it was opened for tourists.

  <strong>Robert Falcon Scott</strong>  CVO (6 June 1868 – 29 March 1912) was a Royal Navy officer and explorer
  who led two expeditions to the Antarctic regions: the Discovery expedition of 1901–1904 and the ill-fated 
  Terra Nova expedition of 1910–1912. <br>

  <a href="../../images/details/stamps/official/bat/2010/bat_2010_5.jpg"><img  hspace="4"

    alt="Robert Falcon Scott"
    title="Robert Falcon Scott" 
    src="../../images/thematic/persons/robert_scott.jpg"></a>

  On the first expedition, he set a new southern record by marching to latitude 82°S and discovered the 
  Antarctic Plateau, on which the South Pole is located. <br>
  On the second venture, Scott led a party of five which reached the South Pole on 17 January 1912, less
  than five weeks after Amundsen's South Pole expedition.<br>
  Scott and his companions died on the second expedition. <br>
  When Scott and his party's bodies were discovered, 16kg of <em>Glossopteris tree</em> (<em>an extinct beech-like 
  tree from 250 million years ago</em>) <em>fossils</em> from Queen Maud Mountains were found next to their bodies, 
  which they had dragged on hand sledges. <br>


  These fossils promised to <a href="#m_stopes">Marie Stopes</a> 
  were to provide evidence for <a href="#suess">Eduard Suess</a>’s 
  hypothesis that Antarctica had once been part of an ancient supercontinent named Gondwanaland 
  (or also referred to as Gondwana).<br>
  
  The plant fossils Scott’s party found on that day in 1912 led to a breakthrough in 
  the geological understanding of Antarctica. 
  It would feed into the burgeoning debate at that time on Gondwanaland, Continental Drift 
  and Antarctica’s role in the formation of the continents.
  At the end it proved that Antarctica had once been warm and connected to other continents as
  suggested by <a href="#suess">Eduard Suess</a>, as the same fossils are found in 
  <a href="../../country/australia.html">Australia</a>, Africa and South America, it was
  like finding a missing piece of the Earth's jigsaw. 
  It indicated that these countries had all been part of the same prehistoric land mass.

  In 1763 he established the Senckenberg Foundation to support natural sciences. <br>
  This founded the Botanischer Garten der Johann Wolfgang Goethe-Universitat Frankfurt am Main. <br>
  His name is honoured in the Senckenberg Gesellschaft fur Naturforschung (Senckenberg Natural History Society) 
  which he endowed and Naturmuseum Senckenberg where many dinosaurs and other fossils are present.

<br><a name="steno"></a> 
  <strong>Nicholas Steno</strong> (1638 - 1686), was a Danish pioneer in both anatomy and geology. <br>
  Already in 1659 he decided not to accept anything simply written in a book, instead
  resolving to do research himself. <br>
  <a href="../../images/sets/denmark_1969_stensen.jpg"><img  hspace="4"
    title="Neils Stensen"
    style="border: 0px solid ; width: 154px; height: 200px; float: left;"

    alt="Shark teeth discovered by Neils Stensen" 
    src="../../images/thematic/persons/steno_nicholas_fossil.jpg"></a>

  He is considered the father of geology and stratigraphy. <br>
  October 1666 two fishermen caught a huge female shark near the town of Livorno, and Ferdinando II 
  de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany, ordered its head to be sent to Steno. <br>
  Steno dissected the head and published his findings in 1667. 
  He noted that the shark's teeth bore a striking resemblance to certain stony objects, found 
  embedded within rock formations, that his learned contemporaries were calling
  glossopetrae or "tongue stones". <br>
  Ancient authorities, such as the Roman author Pliny the Elder, in his Naturalis Historiae, had 
  suggested that these stones fell from the sky or from the Moon. <br>
  Others were of the opinion, also following ancient authors, that fossils naturally grew in
  the rocks. <br>
  Steno's contemporary Athanasius Kircher, for example, attributed fossils to a "lapidifying virtue 
  diffused through the whole body of the geocosm", considered an inherent characteristic of the
  earth an Aristotelian approach. <br>
  Fabio Colonna, however, had already shown in a convincing way that glossopetrae are shark teeth, in 
  his treaty De glossopetris dissertatio published in 1616. <br>
  Steno added to Colonna's theory a discussion on the differences in composition between glossopetrae 
  and living sharks' teeth, arguing that the chemical composition of fossils could be altered
  without changing their form, using the contemporary corpuscular theory of matter. <br>
  Steno's work on shark teeth led him to the question of how any solid object could come to be found 
  inside another solid object, such as a rock or a layer of rock. <br>
  The "solid bodies within solids" that attracted Steno's interest included not only fossils, as we would 
  define them today, but minerals, crystals, encrustations, veins, and even entire rock layers or strata. <br>
  He published his geologic studies in De solido intra solidum naturaliter contento dissertationis prodromus, 
  or Preliminary discourse to a dissertation on a solid body naturally contained within a solid in 1669. <br>
  Steno was not the first to identify fossils as being from living organisms; his contemporaries 
  Robert Hooke and John Ray also argued that fossils were the remains of once-living organisms.

<br><a name="suess"></a> 
  <strong>Eduard Suess</strong> (1831-1914) was born in London on August 20, 1831. <br>
  He was full professor of geology at the University of Vienna and at the same time a
  full member of the Vienna Academy of Sciences.<br>
  <a href="../../images/sets/others/austria_1989_suess.jpg"><img  hspace="4"
    style="border: 0px solid ; width: 166px; height: 213px; float: left;"
    title="Eduard Suess"
     alt="Eduard Suess"
    src="../../images/thematic/persons/suess_eduard.jpg"></a>

  His first book "Der Boden der Stadt Wien" ("The Soil of Vienna"), which dealt with the
  correlation of geologic conditions and water supply, marked the  beginning of his increasing 
  scientific recognition from that time forward. <br>
  He gradually developed views on the  connection between Africa and Europe; eventually he came 
  to the conclusion that the Alps to the north were once at the bottom of an ocean, 
  of which the Mediterranean was a remnant. <br>
  While not quite correct (mostly because plate tectonics had not yet been discovered
  he used the earlier geosyncline theory), this is close enough to the truth that he is credited 
  with postulating the earlier existence of the Tethys Ocean, which he named in 1893. <br>
  Suess postulated that as sediments filled the ocean basins the sea levels gradually rose, and
  periodically there were events of rapid ocean bottom subsidence that   increased the ocean's capacity and caused the regressions. This became
  known as the theory of eustasy (eustacy). <br>
  His other major theory involved glossopteris fern fossils occurring in South America, Africa, and 
  India (as well as Antarctica, though Suess did not know this). <br>
  His explanation was that the three lands were once connected in a supercontinent, which he named Gondwanaland. <br>
  Again, this is not quite correct: Suess believed that the oceans flooded the spaces currently between those 
  lands, when in fact the lands drifted apart. <br>
  Still, it is so similar to what is currently believed that his naming has stuck.

<br><a name="wallace"></a> 
  <strong>Alfred Russel Wallace</strong> (1823-1913) was a British naturalist, explorer, geographer, anthropologist and
  biologist. <br> 
  He is best known for independently proposing a theory of evolution due to natural selection 
  that prompted <a href="../../topics/paleo/personalities/charles_darwin.html">Charles Darwin</a> to publish his own theory.

      alt="Postamrk of UK 1958 - Centenary of Darwin and Wallace Evolution Theory"
      src="../../images/pm/others/uk_1958_pm.jpg"></a>
      
      
  Wallace did extensive fieldwork, first in the Amazon River basin and then in the Malay Archipelago, 
  where he identified the Wallace Line that divides the Indonesian archipelago into two distinct parts, 
  one in which animals closely related to those of Australia are common, and one in which the species are 
  largely of Asian origin. <br>
  He was considered the 19<sup>th</sup> century's leading expert on the geographical distribution of
  animal species and is sometimes called the "father of biogeography". <br>
  Wallace was one of the leading evolutionary thinkers of the 19<sup>th</sup> century and made a number 
  of other contributions to the development of evolutionary theory besides being co-discoverer of 
  natural selection. <br>
  These included the concept of warning colouration in animals, and the Wallace effect, a hypothesis on 
  how natural selection could contribute to speciation by encouraging the development of barriers against
  hybridization. <br>
  Wallace was strongly attracted to unconventional ideas. <br>
  His advocacy of Spiritualism and his belief in a non-material origin for the higher mental faculties of 
  humans strained his relationship with the  scientific establishment, especially with other early 
  proponents of evolution. <br>
  In addition to his scientific work, he was a social activist who was critical of what he considered to 
  be an unjust social and economic system in 19<sup>th</sup> century Britain. <br>
  His interest in biogeography resulted in his being one of the first prominent scientists to raise
  concerns over the environmental impact of human activity. <br>
  Wallace was a  prolific author who wrote on both scientific and social issues; his account of his 
  adventures and observations during his explorations in Indonesia and Malaysia, The Malay Archipelago, 
  was one of the most popular and influential journals of scientific exploration published during the 
  19<sup>th</sup> century.

<br><a name="wegener"></a> 
  <strong>Alfred Lothar Wegener</strong> ( 1880 -1930) was a German scientist, geophysicist, and meteorologist. <br>
  <a href="../../images/sets/others/austria_1980_wegener.jpg"><img  hspace="4"
      style="border: 0px solid ; width: 200px; height: 156px; float: left;" 
      title="Alfred Lothar Wegener"
      alt="Alfred Lothar Wegener"
      src="../../images/thematic/persons/wegener_alfred.jpg"></a>

  He is most notable for his theory of continental drift (Kontinentalverschiebung), proposed in 1912,
  which hypothesized that the continents were slowly drifting around the Earth. <br>
  However, his hypothesis was not accepted until the 1950s, when numerous discoveries such as 
  palaeomagnetism confirmed his hypothesis of continental drift. <br>

  <a href="../../images/sets/others/germany_1980.jpg"><img  hspace="4"
      title="Continent drift theory by Alfred Lothar Wegener"
      style="border: 0px solid ; width: 200px; height: 200px; float: right;"
      alt="Continent drift theory by Alfred Lothar Wegener"
      src="../../images/thematic/persons/wegener_drift_theory.jpg"></a>

  Alfred Wegener first thought of this idea by noticing that the  different large landmasses of the Earth 
  almost fit together like a jigsaw. <br>
  The Continental shelf of the Americas fit closely to Africa and  Europe, and Antarctica, Australia, India 
  and Madagascar fit next to the tip of Southern Africa. But Wegener only took action after reading a 
  paper in Autumn 1911 and seeing that a flooded land-bridge contradicts isostasy. <br>
  Wegener's main interest was meteorology, and he wanted to join the Denmark-Greenland expedition scheduled 
  for mid 1912. <br>
  So he hurried up to present his Continental Drift hypothesis on 6 January 1912. <br>
  He analyzed either side of the Atlantic Ocean for rock type, geological structures and fossils. <br>
  He noticed that there was a significant similarity between matching sides of the continents,
  especially in fossil plants. <br>
  His hypothesis was thus strongly supported by the physical evidence, and was a pioneering attempt at 
  a rational explanation.

<br><a name="worm"></a> 
  <strong>Ole Worm</strong> (1588-1654) was originally physician in Copenhagen, but it was as a naturalist 
  and founder of Denmark's very first museum that he inscribed his name in history. <br>

  <a href="../../images/sets/others/denmark_1988_ole_worm.jpg"><img  hspace="4"
      style="border: 0px solid ; width: 184px; height: 140px; float: left;"

      title="Ammonite discoverd by Ole Worm"
      alt="Ammonite discoverd by Ole Worm"
      src="../../images/thematic/persons/worm_ole_fossil.jpg"></a>

  The museum was named after himself, "Museum Wormianum", and was a true cornucopia of antiquities,
  ethnographic items, and stuffed animals. <br>
  During the Renaissance such museums were established many places in Europe and called "Nature Cabinets" 
  and served as a kind of research libraries for anything not yet described in books. <br>
  The Danish museum no longer exists, but most of the items are now transferred to and on display in the 
  National Museum and Zoological Museum. <br>
  One stamp (the right one) of "Drawings of fossil animals from old books - Historiske Fossile" set
  issued in Denmark on 1998 shows <em>Ammonit parapuzosia</em>, a fossil discovered by Ole Worm. <br>
  The stamp is part of a souvenir sheet containing four different stamps on historic fossils.
