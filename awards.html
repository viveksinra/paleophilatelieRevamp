<br>
	However, after participating in several international philatelic website competitions, 
	I have to say that the competitions are mishandling the exhibition of websites during the actual conferences.<br>

	The only way for visitors to know that this category of exhibition exists at the conferences
	is to read the lists of competing websites in the program. <br>
	The cost of a digital media presentation participating is approximately the same as the fee for a one-frame physical exhibit.  <br>
	One-frame exhibits are clearly displayed on site – but digital media are invisible because there is no way for attendees 
	to see the websites (no computer screens, notebooks, or other electronic displays showing the competing websites).  <br>
	In case there is no room for computers or lack of public internet, it can be possible to add a frame per website with synopsis and some 
	printed screen shots with QR Codes to allow the visitors to get the first impression, then visit it on their mobile 
	devices such as smartphone or tablets. <br>
	<strong>I feel strongly that this is discriminating against digital media.</strong> <br>
	I hope it will change in the future and digital exhibits will be treated more like traditional show displays.

The "Paleophilatelie" website was awarded a Best in Class, 
<strong>LARGE GOLD Medal</strong>, with Special Award
in the competition of philatelic websites at 
<a target="_blank" href="https://cps.gen.nz/wp-content/uploads/19th-NZNPLE-catalogue-F.pdf">the 19<sup>th</sup> New Zealand National Philatelic Literature Exhibition 2025 in Christchurch, New Zealand</a> 
that took place on December 6<sup>th</sup>, 2025.<br>
<br>
<!--
https://cps.gen.nz/literature-exhibitions/
-->
New Zealand has a long tradition of organising biennial specialised literature exhibitions, 
and the 2025 event marked the 19<sup>th</sup> edition of this series. 
The exhibition was organised by the Christchurch Philatelic Society, which has hosted the event 
regularly since 2017. A total of 52 competitive entries were shown. <br>
<br>
Judging followed the New Zealand literature exhibition model, with entries circulated to judges across 
the country well in advance, allowing each exhibit, including electronic literature and websites, 
to be examined in depth. 
Judges later met to finalise marks and provide written feedback. 
All exhibits were displayed at the Christchurch exhibition and subsequently became part of the Society’s 
library, where they remain available for consultation. 
To facilitate access to digital exhibits, two laptops were installed in the exhibition room alongside 
the printed material. <br>

The "Paleophilatelie" website was awarded a

in the competition of philatelic websites at 
<a target="_blank" href="https://ausvipex2025.com/">the Australian Virtual Multi-frame Philatelic Exhibition</a> 
(AUSVIPEX 2025) that took place between November 13<sup>th</sup>, 2025 and February 26<sup>th</sup>, 2026.<br>
<br>
The Australian Virtual Philatelic Exhibition 2025 (AUSVIPEX 2025) was an online National Philatelic
Exhibition organised by the Australian Philatelic Federation.<br>

It showcased philatelic exhibits from collectors in Australia and around the world on a digital platform 
and was designed to allow participation in a traditional competitive stamp exhibition without the need 
to attend in person. <br>
<br>

A unique feature of the exhibition was the Zoom sessions with the juries, which allowed exhibitors to 
speak with jury members to clarify feedback. 
According to the Chair of the Jury, they spent half an hour reviewing the Paleophilatelie website on their 
smartphones.<br>
<br>
As result of the feedback, the <a href="about_website.html"><em>About Paleophilatelie.eu website</em></a> 
page was rewritten to clarify the purpose of the website. <br>

The "Paleophilatelie" website was awarded a 
<strong>Silver Medal</strong> (78 of 100 points) 
in the competition of philatelic websites at 
<a target="_blank" href="https://europhilex2025.co.uk/">the EuroPhilEx 2025</a> 
that took place between May 7<sup>th</sup> and 11<sup>th</sup>, 2025  
in Birmingham, Great Britain<br>
<br>
For the first time ever, Britain decided to move its international philatelic exhibition out of London. 
Birmingham, the country’s second city, is located in the centre of England and is surrounded by a 
large population and several other major cities. <br>

EuroPhilEx Birmingham 2025 was the mid-decade international stamp exhibition for Europe, held under the 
patronage of the Federation of European Philatelic Associations  and with recognition from 
the <span lang="fr">Fédération Internationale de Philatélie</span> (FIP). 
It was organised by the Association of British Philatelic Societies in conjunction with 
Stamp World Exhibitions Ltd. <br>
<br>
Unlike many other philatelic shows, <a href="images/awards/europhilex2025/europhilex_2025_2.jpg">a laptop was installed in the literature corner</a>, 
allowing visitors to view and evaluate philatelic websites entered in the competition. <br>

As is typical of FIP exhibitions, the jury provided no written feedback, offering no explanation 
for the score that Paleophilatelie received on this occasion. <br>
According to the organisers, oral feedback was provided to the national commissioners on demand, 
but I did not receive any feedback from the commissioner who represented my country.<br>

Last year "Paleophilatelie" website was awarded a Large Vermeil 
at <a href="#gass2023">GASS2023</a>. 
Following the feedback received from GASS2023's jury, many modifications 
were done on the "Paleophilatelie" website, which were appreciated by the jury 
this year: <q><em>Incredible information & big improvement over past year.</em></q><br>
<br>

	
The Great American Stamp Show, the annual philatelic convention co-hosted by the three largest philatelic organizations 
in the United States – 
<a target="_blank" href="https://stamps.org/">the American Philatelic Society</a>     (APS), 
<a target="_blank" href="https://americantopical.org/">the American Topical Association</a>        (ATA) and 
<a target="_blank" href="https://afdcs.org/">the American First Day Cover Society</a> (AFDCS).  <br>

The show featured: 100+ booths, 900 frames of stamp exhibits and rarities, 
first day ceremonies, seminars and social gatherings, youth activities/Boy Scout 
Merit Badge Workshop, and more. <br>

<br>
Due to the fact the "Paleophilatelie" website was the only exhibit that participated in 
<a target="_blank"  href="https://stamps.org/Portals/0/Palmares/2024-Literature-Palmares.pdf">the Electronic Literature competition</a> 
no Internet Cafe was present. 
However, the organizers from APS found a compromise.

A <a href="./images/awards/gass2024/snaphot.jpg">printout, synopsis</a>, and some “Visit Paleophilatelie.eu” 
cards for the website were placed on the table with the printed literature.<br>

<br>
The main objective of EXPOFILABRAS 2024 was to promote Philately via the Internet and 
to encourage/train new philatelists, the exhibition being a fraternization between philatelists 
and the general public, with a didactic and cultural nature.<br>
The exhibition contained 155 participants from 33 countries, with 249 exhibitions, 
among collections in 3 categories/classes: general collections, 
philatelic literature and websites.
According to the organizers, during the show, over 6.700 unique visitors 
accessed over 15.000 pages of the exhibition. 
This is much more as it was reported by organizers of  
<a href="#gass2023">the Great American Stamp Show 2023</a> (GASS23).
The GASS23, in Ohio, US, was visited by approximately 2.500 attendees.
<br>

<br>
The unique feature of the exhиbit was public/popular voting on the internet. 
Over 6.000 were received from the visitors of the exhibition.
The vote was open between April 6<sup>th</sup> and April 25 <sup>th</sup>, the 
<a  target="_blank"  href="https://virtuafil.org/public-expo-palmares-list.aspx?exID=5019">vote results and the Palmares</a> 
were published on May 1<sup>st</sup> 2024.  
All exhibits will stay on-line indefinitely.<br>

<br>
In their feedback, about the "Paleophilatelie" website, the jury wrote:
<p style="margin-top: 0px;">
<em><q>A benchmark website by which others are judged. 
	   This is THE reference site for the topical collector in this field. 
	   Content meets purpose 100%. 
	   Hard to find fault...</q></em>

They have drawn worldwide support and have served to introduce collectors, to literature that will develop 
their knowledge and interests. <br>

    The Society has a wide range of sub-groups that explore the different aspects of Philately.
</p>

Together with the literature exhibit, there was COFEX-23 (Christchurch One Frame 
Stamp and Postcard Exhibition), the New Zealand Interclub One Frame Competition, 
and a number of collectables dealers with sales tables. <br>
<br>

Distinguished from most other Philatelic Shows where the "Paleophilatelie" website has participated in 
Electronic-Literature competitions, organizers of NZNPLE-2023 provided detailed feedback, based 
on "Judging Criteria" developed specifically for websites.<br>
<br>
To allow visitors of the show to get an impression of the websites under competition 
a monitor was installed. <br>
Mr. Paul van Herpt, Chairman of the 18th New Zealand National Philatelic Literature Exhibition said:<br>
<em><q>We had a couple of digital classes and so we had a large screen to display them. 
	   For each of the websites I took a number of screenshots and saved them as jpg's. 
	   We had a player that let us run them through so throughout the day images from all digital entries were being display. 
	   A number of times I was questioned what was on the screen so people did notice. 
	   I had borrowed the system from a neighbour who has a furniture shop and he uses it to display 
	   his custom made furniture which was ideal for showing off the digital entries.

Physical copies were laid out on the tables while digital entries scrolled away on the large screen. 
Judging was completed over the weekend of 11/12 November. 
Entries were of high standard, with 6 Large Gold Awards and 7 Gold Awards. 
All this printed material will be available for viewing and use to research in our CPS library.</q></em>
<br>
<br>
According to the catalog of the show, the members of the Jury have worked hard to 
arrive at what is considered to be the fairest result for each exhibitor.
The organizers of the show took over a month to send boxes of printed materials to the 
judges, who were scattered around the country, so each entry could be carefully considered.
After this, the judges had a weekend meeting (one week before the show begins), to 
finalize marks and comments, which enabled them to provide written comments to entrants. <br>

The feedback was detailed and it was clear that the jury took their job seriously, 
spending plenty of time examining many pages of the website. 
The jury even visited

The show is the nation’s biggest philatelic event hosted by the three largest philatelic organizations 
in the United States – 
<a target="_blank" href="https://stamps.org/">the American Philatelic Society</a> (APS), 
<a target="_blank" href="https://americantopical.org/">Topical Association</a> (ATA) and 
<a target="_blank" href="https://afdcs.org/">the American First Day Cover Society</a> (AFDCS).  <br>
GASS2023 was supported by the United States Postal Service who hosted a large retail area as well as two first day ceremonies.  
GASS2023  featured 100+ dealers selling stamps and covers, hundreds of frames of stamp exhibits and rarities, 
participation of 40+ national specialty societies, a youth area, and 100+ meetings and seminars. <br>
<br>
Distinguished from 
<a href="./images/awards/omaha2019/omaha2019_medal.jpg">the APS Stamps Show 2019 in Omaha</a>, 
the participator name was not engraved on the reverse side, but stuck on the plastic case.  
The certificate was not provided.
<br>
Due to the fact only four exhibits participated in 
<a target="_blank"  href="https://stamps.org/Portals/0/Palmares/2023-Literature-Palmares.pdf">the Electronic Literature competition</a> 
no Internet Cafe was installed. 
However, the organizers from APS were ready to find a compromise.
A <a href="./images/awards/gass2023/Paleophilatelie_printout.jpg">printout</a> and some visit cards 
of "Paleophilatelie.eu" website were placed on the table with printed literature. <br>
<br>

The feedback of the jury was provided together with how the score was split. 
It was useful and led to several changes on multiple pages of the website, including the home page.
Moreover, the feedback contained the name and email address of the jury representative with the following note: <br>
<q>TO THE EXHIBITOR: Should any aspect of this form be unclear, or should you like more detailed comments 
	from your jury representative, please contact that individual using the listed email address.</q><br>
The jury representative kindly answered my questions and clarified some points.<br>
<em>This makes a big difference compared with the FIP stamp shows, such as IBRA2023, CapeTown2023, and London2022.</em>

<a target="_blank" href="https://ibra2023.de/">IBRA 2023</a> was an International Stamp World Exhibition that was 
organized by <a href="http://www.bdph.de/">the Philatelic Federation of Germany</a>  
(Bund Deutscher Philatelisten - BDPh) under the patronage of 
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.f-i-p.ch/">the international philatelic federation FIP</a> 
and recognised by 
<a target="_blank" href="https://fepanews.com/">the Federation of European Philatelic Associations</a>. <br>

Up to 3400 frames were available for qualified collections in all competition classes. <br>
64 of 809 exhibits were awarded Large Gold medals and 196 Gold medals. <br>
At the same time, the 33<sup>rd</sup> International Stamp Fair took place, to which about 150 postal 
administrations or their agencies, dealers, auction houses and equipment manufacturers attended.
Numerous information stands of associations as well as of working and research communities  
provided a deeper insight into the many facets of philately. <br>
<br>
German Federal Chancellor Olaf Scholz, wrote a short greeting note for the show attendees:
<br>
<q><em>
	Stamps are first and foremost official postage stamps, but they are also much more that. 
	They are often little works of art, sent into the world as ambassadors of their country, 
	telling stories of famous places and landscapes, about significant personalities of 
	contemporary history, art, and culture or great achievements in science and technology. <br>
	Thus, philately – collecting stamps – is always a trip to other worlds. 
	It is a hobby that has a long tradition, and it educates and connects people. 
	It brings together collectors with those who are interested, like it will do at the 
	IBRA 2023 World Exhibition in Essen. 
	I am very pleased that, after many years, this beautiful exhibition can take place 
	in Germany again...
</em></q> [The previous Philatelic World Exhibition in Germany took place in 1999 
           in <span lang="de">Nürnberg</span>.]

Electronic Philatelic Literature at GASS 2023
-->

A separate Philatelic Literature area was hosted by the show. 
The area was 150 square meters in size. 
All printed materials under competition were available for the public to read and review. <br>
The literature area was managed and supervised by the 
<a target="_blank" href="https://aijp.org/">International Association of the Philatelic Journalists and Authors</a> 
(AIJP). <br>

According to the show organizers, the digital philatelic literature (websites) were supposed to be available to 
the public in the Internet Corner of the Philatelic Literature Area. 
A monitor was indeed available in the corner on one of the tables, but there was no internet connection. 
Perhaps the organizers found it too expensive? The monitor was also not connected to power either. <br>

As with every philatelic show that the "Paleophilatelie" website has participated, the only place where visitors 
were able to find it was in the show catalog. 
The catalog was free of charge for the exhibitors, but costed €10 for the public. <br>
<br>
This time I had the opportunity to visit the exhibition personally. <br>
The supervisor from the AIJP kindly allowed me to place 
a <a href="images/awards/Paleophilatelie_printout.jpg">printout</a> and some 
<a href="images/awards/PaleoPhilatelie_visitCard.jpg">visitor cards</a> at 
the monitor. <br> 

Another thing to mention is that the show provided a feedback session on the last day of the show. 
Exhibitors had the opportunity to get jury feedback during 10 minute conversations with the jury. 
However, the literature exhibits (including both printed and digital) were excluded from this feedback session.<br>

<br>

The International Philatelic Exhibition took place at the Cape Town International Convention Centre 2 (CTICC2) .
Entry was free to the public.
This event featured 1600 competitive frames and 69 literature exhibits, including websites from 43 countries.
<br>
The biggest areas by category: Postal history (397 frames); Traditional (395 frames);
Thematic (162 frames); Aerophilately (92 frames). There were 64 frames in the
Championship class. <br>
According to the organizers, computer with internet access and the list of the websites 
who took part of the competition were available in the Literature show-room. <br>
<br>
The show was organized by Philatelic Federation of South Africa (PFSA), in conjunction with the Department of
Communications and Digital Techmologies, under patronage of the Fédération Internationale de Philatélie 
(<a target="_blank" href="https://www.f-i-p.ch/">FIP</a>). <br>
<br>
A key aim of the International Stamp Exhibition was to generate interest for philately among a 
broader cross-section of South African society, and in that way to promote it as a hobby. <br>
A highlight of the event was the award-winning exhibit by Gerhard Kamffer entitled "The Road to
Democracy". Letters written by Nelson Mandela from Robben Island and other important artefacts of
South Africa’s history were displayed. <br>

formal philatelic organisations, designed to minimize restrictions and maximize open and zero-cost participation at exhibitions. <br>
As an independent organisation, Virtuafil has instituted a new, distinct Philatelic Class: “Websites and Social Media”. <br>
This new Class is not connected with the traditional Class of Philatelic Literature. <br>

	   <a href="images/awards/filananias2021/score-jury-5011-138.jpg">The jury feedback</a>: <br>
		<em>
		"This is simply one of the very best philatelic websites out there. <br>
		The statement on the site is "the most comprehensive catalog about Paleontology and Paleoanthropology in Philately" and I believe this is quite correct. <br>
		The amount of information available seems almost limitless and the philatelic knowledge on show is of the highest level,
		where each issue is studied in minute detail. <br>
		There seems to be no aspect of this theme that has been left unexplored. <br>
		I was particularity impressed with the section that talks about undesirable stamp issue from various African countries. <br>
		This is an area rarely mentioned in philately. <br>
		<br>
		Criticisms:  <br>
		 Difficult to find anything to criticize here.  
		 It's a labour of many years devotion. <br>
		 The site might look a little more modern if the standard Times New Roman was replaced with something a little more "modern". <br>
		 Otherwise...this is a major philatelic resource for this theme of Paleontology and Paleoanthropology."

"www.Paleophilatelie.eu" website awarded by <strong>Large Vermeil Medal</strong>
in "Electronic" Literature sub-category. <br>
<br>
Due the fact that synopsis of the website not forwarded
by the show organizers to the jury, some of juries comments was irrelevant. 
Other comments, especially about "Treatment"
section was useful and lead to redesign of <a href="index.html">home page</a> and several other main pages of
the website. <br>
<br>
<em>It was a pleasure and good experience to participate the show and I was
happy to get some comments of the jury, but was disappointed by the fact
that most of the visitors weren't aware about website
competition as no screens nor monitors installed there to provide
visitors a possibility to visit it. 
The only place where visitors was able to get information about participated website is a
brochure with list of all participators and addresses of websites. </em>

participated in "<a target="_blank" href="http://expo.fsfi.it/italia2018/en_result.php"><strong>ITALIA 2018</strong></a>"

</p>

<em>Unfortunately, jury provided the score split only, without any feedback or comments. 
Really pity as the score itself doesn't allow to draw any conclusion how to improve a website for next
competition. 
I also have a doubt if anybody except the jury was aware about the websites competition 
and visited it during or right after the show. 
According to a fellow collector who visited the show, no screen or monitors installed there to allow visitors to see
participated websites.</em><br>
