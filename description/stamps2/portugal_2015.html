On May 4<sup>th</sup>, 2015, the Post Authority of Portugal introduced 3 
new self-adhesive ATM stamps with dinosaurs design. 

Similar to the stamps from <a href="portugal_1999.html">1999</a>-<a href="portugal_2002.html">2002</a>, 
these stamps were sold at vending machines. 
The stamps were sold at 7 predefined values. 
Only one vendor was used this time for the stamps - NewVision. <br>

NewVision e-Post 2000 vending machine, which was first installed in Portugal in December 2000, 
was available in most of the post offices and at the philatelic desk.

Another type of vending machine of the same company, e-Post 2000M (Modular) was available in  
a few post offices only.
This type of vending machine has a bigger choice of predefined values, according to weight,
destination, and type of shipping required.
The stamps with these extra values are rare. <br>

Two special commemorative postmarks designed for stamps presentations in Lisbon and Porto 
on the day of stamps issue 
(nowadays, Post of Portugal is always made two post marks one for Lisbon and another for Porto, 
the second largets city of Portugal, to provide a possibility to more philatelist to cancel some 
covers and stamps). 
An additional commemorative postmark was designed on request of the Lourinha city community. 
Lourinha is the place where fossils of all 3 dinosaurs were found and where they can be seen in
“Museu Da Lourinha”. <br>

An extra postmark designed for the 47<sup>the</sup> Expo National stamp fair in Madrid, which took place only 3
days after the stamps were issued, and where the Portuguese Post was invited for the first time and 
presented their dinosaur stamps along other philatelic products. <br>
On the first day of the fair, the Spanish Post also presented their 
<a href="../../images/sets/spain_2015.jpg">first ever stamps set dedicated to dinosaurs</a>. <br>
This year, the main theme of the fair was linked to these prehistoric animals, 
with the intention of attracting the children and young people in addition to those interested 
in philately. <br>
The Spanish stamps use special printing techniques for the stamps
(phosphorescence, flaky texture and 3D), but the dinosaurs look like a
cartoon or children drawing. <br>
<br>


<br>

<center><h3><em>The following dinosaurs were depicted on the ATM stamps</em></h3></center>

<em>Allosaurus europaeus</em>, <em>Ceratosaurus sp.</em> and <em>Torvosaurus gurneyi</em>. 
The stamps were illustrated by Fernando Correia who has been one of the paleontological
illustration promoters in Portugal and a member of the International
Competition Jury of Dinosaur Illustration (IDRC) sponsored by GEAL -Museum of Lourinha.<br>

<strong><em>Torvosaurus gurneyi</em></strong> named in honour of the
famous American paleoartist James Gurney – creator of the utopian world of Dinotopia, 
who also designed dinosaur stamps for 
<a href="usa_1997.html"> USA in 1997</a> and 
<a href="australia_2013.html">Australia 2013</a>. <br>

<em>Torvosaurus</em> was the largest land predator that lived in Portugal and throughout Europe. 
His skull average is more than a meter long and a whole would weigh
between 4-5 tons and was about 10 meters long. 
Despite its colossal size, they are also known for their embryos, rare findings that
can be seen at the Museum of Lourinha. <br>


<p class="notes">
	<a name="museum"></a>
	<strong>The Museu da Lourinha</strong> (the Museum of Lourinha) holds the main dinosaur collection of the country. 
	The museum was founded in 1984 by GEAL - Grupo de Etnologia e Arqueologia da
	Lourinha (Lourinha's Group of Ethnology and Archeology). <br>
	The museum has very complete exhibits of archaeology and ethnology, but the
	main focus of the museum is the <strong>palaeontology</strong> hall, which presents casts of famous 
	<a href="#dinosaurs">dinosaurs</a>, as well as fossils recovered from the Late Jurassic Lourinha Formation. <br>
	Among these is the famous theropod nest found at the beach of Paimogo,
	which contains eggs with embryos inside, probably belonging to 
	<em>Lourinhanosaurus</em> (depicted on one of the <a href="portugal_1999.html">ATM stamps in 1999</a>). 
	In 2011, the Museum issued 
	<a href="../../images/sets/personalized/portugal_2011_personalized.jpg">its own personalized stamps</a> 
	showing six "domestic" dinosaurs.	
</p>


In March 2014, Sky-News reported about two paleontologists from Portugal who described a
new species of giant dinosaur. 
Fossilized bones of this dinosaur were unearthed from the Lourinha Formation near Lisbon, Portugal.
They were originally believed to be <em>Torvosaurus tanneri</em>, a dinosaur species
that lived in what is now North America during the Jurassic, 153 to 148 million years ago. <br>

But closer comparison of the shin bone, upper jawbone, teeth, and partial tail vertebrae 
suggest to the paleontologists that it may be a previously unknown <em>Torvosaurus</em> species. 
The number of teeth, as well as size and shape of the mouth, may differentiate the European and 
the American <em>Torvosaurus</em>.
The fossil of the upper jaw of <em>Torvosaurus tanneri</em> has 11 or more teeth, while 
<em>Torvosaurus gurneyi</em> has fewer than 11, and the mouth bones have a different shape and structure. 
Fossilised remains of other closely related dinosaurs suggest <em>Torvosaurus gurneyi</em> may have been
covered with "protofeathers" – the precursors of bird feathers. <br>
	
“With a skull of 1.15 meters, <em>Torvosaurus gurneyi</em> was however one of the largest terrestrial carnivores 
at this epoch, and an active predator that hunted other large dinosaurs, as evidenced
by blade shape teeth up to 10 cm.” said lead author Dr Christophe Hendrickx from the Universidade Nova de Lisboa 
and the Museu da Lourinha, Portugal.<br>
<br>


<strong><em>Ceratosaurus</em></strong>,
was a large predatory theropod dinosaur, about 5-7 meters long and 
weighing up to 980 kilograms, from the Late Jurassic Period (about 150
million years ago), found in the Morrison Formation of North America,
and the Lourinha Formation of Portugal. <br>
In Portugal, there are no known elements  of his skull. 
Still, it is known that the anatomy of various elements of the members is
very similar to those known in North America. 
It was characterized by large jaws with blade-like teeth, a large, blade-like 
horn on the snout and a pair of hornlets over the eyes. 
The forelimbs were powerfully built but very short. 
A row of small osteoderms (armor plates) was  present down the middle of the back. <br>
<br>



The last stamp of the set is one of the great predators best known in Portugal: 
the <strong><em>Allosaurus</em></strong> (appeared on stamps from 
<a href="portugal_1999.html">1999</a> - see on the right).
It is known for the skull, teeth, vertebrae and many other elements of its skeleton. 
It also lived in North America, however, there are some differences
between American and the Portuguese species which have been justified by some experts. <br>
