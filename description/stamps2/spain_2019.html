On May 2<sup>nd</sup>, 2019, Post
Authority of Spain issued the tenth stamp of set "12 month, 12 stamps,
12 regions". This stamp dedicated to La Rioja province.
<br>
<br>
<small>A province that throughout history
has been a land of passage, borders, battles but today, thanks to its
long history, contains numerous attractions that make us stop and stop
to know this province. Sometimes it is known as " that of the seven
valleys " because geographically it is divided by seven rivers that
descend from the mountain towards the Ebro, which is the backbone of
the region. Traditionally, it is divided into three subregions from
west to east, following the course of the Ebro: La Rioja Alta, La
Rioja Media and La Rioja Baja . Each of them with their corresponding
central and service municipalities.<br><br>
Under the letters LR and the color green in the lower strip as the
color of the province of La Rioja, different characteristic elements of
this province have been included.<br><br>
The logo of the Calceate Jubilee Year (1019-2019), which began on
April 25, 2019 and will end on January 12, 2020, in Santo Domingo de la
Calzada. A thousand years ago, Santo Domingo de la Calzada was born, a
key figure in the consolidation of the Camino de Santiago as an open
route for pilgrims from all over the world. The Calceate Jubilee Year
is a direct allusion to this millennium, a tribute to the origins of a
vocation and the foundations of a spiritual Path that has been
essential in the tourist, cultural, heritage and social development of
La Rioja.<br><br>
Monumentally they appear on the stamp on one side a tower of the Yuso
Monastery in San Millán de la Cogolla and on the other, the interior of
the Valvanera Monastery, the latter also known for a traditional liquor
that continues to be produced today. One of the riches of the
Monasteries is their libraries since these spaces were nerve centers of
culture, especially in the Middle Ages. The monastery archive and
library of the Yuso Monastery is considered among the best in Spain,
where two cartularies and three hundred original volumes are kept. The
origin of the construction of the monastery is reflected in a legend
that tells how King García, that of Nájera, ordered the transfer of the
remains of San Millán that were in Suso to the monastery of Santa María
La Real de Nájera. The oxen pulling the cart stopped the valley as if
the remains of the Saint did not want to abandon it, building the
current Yuso monastery there. A Romanesque monastery from the 10th and
11th centuries, of which there are currently no remains, on which the
current Yuso monastery was built between the 16th and 18th centuries by
the Benedictine abbots. The Benedictine monks moved to the monastery in
the 10th century. One of the most relevant abbots was Domingo, a native
of the Rioja town of Cañas, better known as Santo Domingo de Silos.<br><br>
A glass of wine appears to honor the Rioja PDO, which is the oldest in
Spain (1925) and the first to obtain the Qualified (1991), being,
therefore, a pioneer in the good work of wine.<br><br>
Every July 22 in the town of Anguiano and coinciding with the Feast of
the Magdalena, the spectacular dance takes place on wooden stilts 45 cm
high, performed by eight young people from the town dressed in colored
vests and yellow skirts that are thrown from the church along the
cobbled slope to the plaza.

There
are written documents on the dance of
Anguiano dated in 1603, although a much older origin is supposed. It is
in any case the oldest folk manifestation in La Rioja. </small>

<br>
More
than 120 million years ago in this place, Enciso, <span style="font-weight: bold;">dinosaurs</span> lived
. They lived in a unique enclave, in the ancient Tethys Sea, where they
left their footprints. Today we continue to be amazed with their habitat,
their food, their way of life, hunting ... that is, with the authentic
nature of the great saurians.<br>
<br>
Numerous trace fossils of dinosaurs have been found in the area and there is a museum specialized in paleontology in Enciso<br>
