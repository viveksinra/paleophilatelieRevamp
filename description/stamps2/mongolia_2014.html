<br>

The Ministry of Culture, Sport and Tourism of Mongolia together with
the "Mongol Post" (Mongol Shuudan) jointly released the postal
stamp <em>Tarbosaurus  Bataar</em>". 
Both organizations officially introduced the new postal product to 
the Central Dinosaur Museum (CDM) on Thursday, July 24<sup>th</sup>, 2014. <br>
<br>
These stamps were printed as a Souvenir-Sheet of 4 stamps and two sheets, 20 stamps each.
All stamps show fossils and reconstructions of one of the most famous 
Mongolian dinosaurs <em>Tarbosaurus bataar</em>. <br>
<br>

<strong><em>Tarbosaurus</em></strong> is a genus of tyrannosaurid theropod dinosaur 
that flourished in Asia about 70 million years ago, at the end of the Late Cretaceous.
Its fossils have been recovered in <a href="../../country/mongolia.html">Mongolia</a>, 
with more fragmentary remains found further afield in parts of 
<a href="../../country/china.html">China</a>. <br>
Although many species have been named, modern paleontologists recognize only
one as a valid species: <em>Tarbosaur bataar</em>. <br> 
<em>Tarbosaurus</em> and <em>Tyrannosaurus</em>, if not synonymous, 
are considered to be at least closely related genera. <br>
Like most known tyrannosaurids, <em>Tarbosaurus</em> was a large bipedal
predator, weighing up to six tonnes and equipped with about sixty large teeth. 
It had a unique locking mechanism in its lower jaw and the
smallest forelimbs relative to body size of all tyrannosaurids,
renowned for their disproportionately tiny, two-fingered forelimbs. 
It was an apex predator, preying on other dinosaurs. <br> 

<br>
In 1946, a joint Soviet-Mongolian expedition to the Gobi Desert in the
Mongolian Omnogovi Province discovered a large theropod skull and some
vertebrae in the Nemegt Formation. <br>
In 1955, Evgeny Maleev, a Soviet paleontologist, made this specimen, the type specimen of a new species, 
which he called <em>Tyrannosaurus bataar</em>. 
The specific name is a misspelling of the Mongolian <span lang="ru">баатар</span>/baatar ("hero"). <br>
A nearly complete <em>Tyrannosaurus bataar</em> skeleton was returned to Mongolia
following the high-profile prosecution of a Florida paleontologist by
federal authorities in New York after it was sold at a Manhattan auction for 
$1.05 million. <br>

<br>
During the ceremony of introduction of the new postal stamp "<em>Tyrannosaurus Bataar</em>",
the Minister of Culture, Sport and Tourism Ts. Oyungerel noted: <br>
<q><em>After the rare findings of the Tarbosaurus Bataar skeleton, the noticeable
sculpture artworks and fine-art paintings have been delivered; and this time, 
the new postal stamp was also released with great efforts from the "Mongol Shuudan". 
This remarkable event will surely contribute to protect our cultural heritages as well 
as to provide value-added cultural and economic impact to Mongolia.... 
The launch of these new postmarks celebrates both the 90<sup>th</sup> anniversary of 
Mongolia’s postmark production and modern museum establishment in Mongolia. 
It is delightful to see Bataar becoming the theme of postmarks.</em><q><br>

The original painting of the “<em>Tarbosaurus Bataar</em>” postage stamp was drawn by
the painter Ch. Bat-Erdene and graphically designed by J. Gankhuyag. <br>
Ch. Bat-Erdene talked about how he created Bataar:
<q><em>Stamp depictions requires more intricate drawings compared to other pieces for publications. 
I spent two months drawing Bataar for the stamps. 
Each depiction to be used for stamps is always based on detailed research
before going to design, as they represent Mongolia’s name in the international postage market.</em></q><br>

<br>
<strong>“The Central Dinosaur Museum ” in Ulaanbaatar</strong> was
established to protect, register and verify fossils, all in order to
preserve Mongolian heritage for future generations.  <br>

The museum opened its doors on February 21<sup>st</sup>, 2013 in the building of the former Lenin Museum, 
which was in operation until 1990s. <br>
The very first exhibition "<em>Tarbosaurus bataar</em> come home" 
took place between June 8<sup>th</sup> and September 15<sup>th</sup>, 2013. 
The estimated number of visitors to the exhibition was half a million people, a record for attendance 
to a Mongolian museum.
During the exhibition the museum ran some educational programs for kids and student about dinosaurs and paleontology. 
To date (2014) this is the only dinosaur museum in Mongolia. <br>
Another exhibition "<em>Tarbosaurus bataar</em> and amazing dinosaurs"
was opened on July 10<sup>th</sup>, 2014. 
This exhibition showed <em>Tarbosaurus bataar</em> as well as many other dinosaur's 
fossils such as <em>Saichania, Gallimimus, Oviraptor, Protoceratops</em>. 

The Central Dinosaur Museum has introduced 48 different dinosaur-themed postcards since 
2013 as well as paintings and the story books for children.
The books tell the story how the skeleton of <em>Tarbosaurus</em>  was returned to Mongolia 
from the United States. 
The Central Dinosaur Museum in Ulaanbaatar was built specially for and dedicated to Mongolia’s dinosaurs. 

<br>
Mongol Post expressed its interest in opening a branch in the Central Dinosaur Museum 
building, as tourists prefer to collect postcards or send postcards to share their 
impressions of the museums they have visited with their friends and family at home. <br>
<br>


<h2>The story of how <em>Tarbosaurus bataar</em> returned to Mongolia</h3> 
A nearly complete skeleton of a towering <em>Tyrannosaurus bataar</em>
was set to go on auction at the Texas-based Heritage Auction on 
Sunday, May 20<sup>th</sup>, 2012.

The <em>Tyrannosaurus bataar</em> was uncovered in the Gobi Desert roughly in 2004 and has an
estimated value of $950,000. 
Also called <em>Tarbosaurus bataar</em>, this species is an Asian relative to the North American 
<em>Tyrannosaurus rex</em>.
While the specimen's skull is 80 percent complete, the body is about 75 percent complete. <br>
There is no reasonable doubt that the <em>Tarbosaurus</em> had been stolen.

<a href="../../country/china.html">China</a> and 
<a href="../../country/mongolia.html">Mongolia</a> strictly regulate who is allowed to 
launch dinosaur expeditions and collect fossils and where those specimens must be reposited. 
There was no legal route by which the dinosaur could have ended up in a New York City 
auction. 
Days before it was set to be sold, paleontologists and the president of Mongolia 
objected to the auction.
Paleontologist Mark Norell of the American Museum of Natural History,
who has worked extensively in Mongolia, pointed out that the dinosaur
must be an illicit specimen from the Gobi Desert. 

<p class="notes">
	Mark Allen Norell (born July 26, 1957) is an American vertebrate paleontologist. 
	He is currently the chairman of paleontology and a research associate at the 
	American Museum of Natural History. 
	He is best known as the discoverer of the first theropod embryo and for the 
	description of feathered dinosaurs. 
	Norell is credited with the naming of the genera 
	<em>Apsaravis, Byronosaurus, Citipati, Tsaagan</em>, and <em>Achillobator</em>. 
	His work regularly appears in major scientific journals 
	(including cover stories in Science and Nature) and was listed by Time magazine 
	as one of the ten most significant science stories of 1993, 1994 and 1996. 
	Norell is both a fellow of the Explorer's Club and the Willi Hennig Society. 
	He was featured in the fourth installment of Miracle Planet—a six-part documentary 
	series that was released in 2005.

According to Mongolian heritage laws, any recovered bones must ultimately rest
within an approved Mongolian institution. <br>
Heritage Auctions pooh-poohed the concerns and affirmed that
the auction house trusted the dealer it was working with. 
Greg Rohan, president of Heritage Auctions, steadfastly defended the auction,
whining that it was too close to the date of the auction to do anything
about the complaints of the Mongolian government and concerned researchers. 
Lawyers working in concert with the Mongolian government entered the kerfuffle 
and demanded that the auction be halted until the provenance of the skeleton could be settled. 
The auction went ahead as scheduled. 
In the middle of the bidding, a lawyer announced that he had on the phone a judge who had issued 
an order against the sale. 
Even this last-minute tactic didn’t stop the bidding. 
The final price of the <em>Tarbosaurus</em> was just over $1 million. 
Fortunately, the unknown buyer couldn’t simply walk off with the dinosaur. 
Investigations continued, now with the begrudging assistance of Heritage Auctions, 
and Norell and other paleontologists confirmed that the tyrannosaur must have been 
uncovered in Mongolia. 
More than that, what was billed as a nearly complete individual animal turned out
to be made of several different dinosaurs. <br>

The investigation revealed that the origin of the bones had been obscured by shipping 
them from Great Britain to the United States labeled as assorted reptile fossils. 
By June 22, 2012, Eric Prokopi - a self-described "commercial paleontologist" was
identified as the dealer, and the skeleton had been seized by the United States government. 
He was arrested on October 17, 2012, on 
"one count of conspiracy to smuggle illegal goods, possess stolen property, and make 
false statements, one count of smuggling goods into the United States, and one count of 
interstate sale and receipt of stolen goods," a press statement read. 
Prokopi pled guilty to the charges on December 27, 2012. 
His cooperation during the investigation led to the discovery of several other stolen 
fossilized remains. 
Prokopi has been sentenced to three months in prison, Associated Press reported.<br>

On May 17, 2013, the 70-million-year-old <em>Tyrannosaurus bataar</em> skeleton
finally returned to its homeland. 
The delivery landed on “Chinggis Khaan” International Airport at 11:15 pm, where 
authorities from the Government including Head of the Office of the President P. Tsagaan, 
Minister of the Cabinet Office of the Government of Mongolia Ch. Saikhanbileg, 
Minister for Culture, Sports and Tourism Ts. Oyungerel and other officials were 
present to receive the <em>Tarbosaurus bataar</em>. <br>
The fossils were packaged in 7 boxes and delivered by “Korean Air”. 
This is the first ever repatriated fossils and officials was saying dozens of
dinosaur findings will be returned by air and ship transportation soon.  <br>
