<br>
On July 28<sup>st</sup>, 2023, the Mexican Postal Service company
also known as Sepomex, issued the set of 3 stamps 
"Prehistoric Dimensions". <br>
These stamps were issued in cooperation with the Desert Museum of Saltillos, Coahuila.
Fossils of all three prehistoric animals, two dinosaurs:
<a href="#coahuilaceratops"><em>Coahuilaceratops</em></a>, 
<a href="#antholipan"><em>Acantholipan</em></a> 
and a shark <a href="#aquilolamna"><em>Aquilolamna</em></a> were discovered 
in the desert and are in the Museum's collection. 
This is the second stamps set with prehistoric animals, 
issued by the Mexican Postal Service company in cooperation with the Desert Museum.
The previous stamps set, "<a href="mexico_2006.html">Dinosaurs of Mexico</a>" was 
issued in 2006. <br>
<br>

The Desert Museum is a museum in Saltillo (850km away from Mexico City), Coahuila, 
that promotes an ecological culture by showing the wealth of life and 
the evolution of species, including many fossils through time in an interactive way. <br>

<p class="notes">
	The Chihuahuan Desert is a desert ecoregion designation covering parts of 
	northern <a href="../../country/mexico.html">Mexico</a> and the southwestern 
	<a href="../../country/mexico.html">United States</a>. 
	It occupies much of far West Texas, the middle to lower Rio Grande Valley and 
	the lower Pecos Valley in New Mexico, and a portion of south-eastern Arizona, 
	as well as the central and northern portions of the Mexican Plateau.
</p>

The Museum was designed by the architect Francisco López Guerra and was inaugurated 
on 25 November 1999.  <br>
The museum is divided into four main pavilions with different themes:
<ul style="margin-top: 0px;">
	<li>"The desert and its past"</li>
	<li>"Man and the desert: A space of meetings"</li>
	<li>"Evolution and biodiversity"</li>
	<li>"The laboratory of life"</li>
</ul>

"The desert and its past" section of the museum 
features, among other objects, <strong>dinosaurs</strong>, <strong>pterosaurs</strong> 
and <strong>prehistoric marine reptiles</strong> who lived in the region in the 
deep past, as well as interactive displays about recent discoveries in the 
<strong>palaeontology</strong> of the region. <br>

"Evolution and biodiversity is dedicated to the evolution of life in the area over 
the past 12,000 years. During this time frame, the region was home to 
<strong>mammoths</strong>, <strong>saber-toothed cats</strong>, 
<strong>short-faced bears</strong>, and <strong>gomphotheres</strong>."

<span lang="sp">Luis Gómez Sánchez</span>,
the President of the Board of Directors of the Desert Museum, explained 
these stamps were issued to represent more than 20 years of paleontological research 
and collaboration by the museum. 
Through them, the message of conservation will be reflected in history and will 
become pieces highly valued by collectors and philately enthusiasts.  <br>

He stated that nowadays is a very important moment for the development of all Mexican 
paleontology due to the extraordinary findings in Mexico, with dinosaurs of new genera 
and new species that have been discovered. <br>
<q><em>We are doing a whole process of conservation of Mexican paleontology to be 
   able to perfectly identify those fossils to conserve them and make them known 
   to the world through the postage stamps issued in coordination with the Mexican 
   Postal Service.</em></q><br>

<p class="notes">
	The first records of  discoveries of prehistoric gigantic bones in
	what is today Mexico begins with the mythology of pre-Hispanic Aztecs. 
	The first documented report about dinosaur's footprints were 
	made in 1867 by French geologists M. M. Dollfus and E. de Montserrat. <br>

	The foundation of the Mexican Geological Commission in 1886 and two years later, 
	the Instituto Geológico Nacional (IGN), provided a solid substratum for 
	geological and paleontological studies in Mexico. <br>

	The first paleontological collection of the Institutional Museum was established 
	by José Guadalupe Aguilera, and for that reason, he is considered the father 
	of Paleontology in Mexico.  <br>

    However, even when earlier paleontological studies in Mexico include diverse fossil 
	groups, most of the paleontological studies were published by foreign scientists 
	until the beginning of the 1990s.

	The systematic paleontological research in Mexico began after foundation of 
	the Mexican Paleontologic Society (Sociedad Mexicana de Paleontología - SOMEXPAL) 
	in 1986, as result of raise public interest on paleontology based on several discoveries 
	at that time.<br>
	
	Nowadays it is the most important professional paleontological association in Mexico 
	that agglutinates a large number of specialists in the country with research lines 
	that include in order of published works: 
	invertebrate paleontology, vertebrate paleontology, micropaleontology, 
	paleobotany and paleobiological studies.
</p>

Mrs. <span lang="sp">Bárcena Molina</span>, the General Director of the Mexican Postal Service 
company (SEPOMEX), said at the stamps presentation ceremony: <br>  
<q><em>The postage stamps issued by each nation have that important mission, to be 
	   cultural ambassadors of their countries working in favor of culture, 
       in Correos de México we are passionate about thinking that, through a postage 
	   stamp, these fascinating species will travel our territory and 191 more 
	   countries than those that are part of the Universal Postal Union.</em></q><br>


<br>
The title of the stamps set "Dimensiones Prehistoricas" 
(in English Prehistoric Dimensions) is the same as the temporary exhibition organized 
by the Desert Museum.
The Museum, displayed fossils and replicas of prehistoric animals 
in one of the most iconic places of the Mexico City: The Los Pinos Cultural Complex, 
between June 10<sup>th</sup> and October 8<sup>th</sup> 2023. <br>
Some media called the exhibition "Dinos en Los Pinos" (in English: Dinosaurs in Los Pinos)
This exhibition was the result of joint efforts of 
the Foreign Ministry with the Museum of the Desert of Coahuila 
and the Federal Ministry of Culture. <br>

<br>
These stamps were presented to the public on July 28<sup>th</sup>, 2023, in 
the Los Pinos Cultural Complex.<br>

written by <span lang="sp">Arturo González González and José Manuel Padilla Gutiérrez</span>
<p><em>
	<q>Dinosaurs have been one of the most successful animal groups on
		earth, as evolution terms and fame. 
		They have been central characters in movies, science fiction novels, 
		fairy tales, legends and all kinds of cartoons. 
		These majestic organisms have stimulated the imagination of children, adults, 
		scientists, writers and filmmakers. <br>
		<br>
		Incredibly, in each stratum of fine sediments that were deposited one by
		one in depths of ancient seas and coastal territories, today's well-known
		Chihuahuan Desert, contain stories of a gigantic book that include past 
		diversity knowledge.
		They are proof of the events that occurred in these territories,
		which are expressed through the remains and evidence of different
		organisms that were trapped for millions of years between these substrates. <br>
		<br>
		With a history of more than 165 million years, they occupied practically all 
		available habitats on the continents of their geological time. 
		Their paleodiversity reached significant levels within the continental and 
		marine vertebrates, in this way specialists estimate that they produced more 
		than 1,500 species. <br>
		<br>
		The dinosaur research now developing in Mexico have had a better understanding
		of the environments that existed in Southern North America 70 million years ago. <br>
		<br>
		Currently, The Chihuahuan Desert is the area with the largest range of dinosaur
		fossils within the national territory. 
		This is due to the peculiar location of this territory 70 million years ago, 
		a time when there was a system of rushing mouth rivers in this area, which in 
		turn caused the development of marshes, lagoons and marshes.

The exhibition, was distributed in 6 sections (dimensions), shows life-size reconstructions  
of prehistoric animal that inhabited the Earth over millions of years supported with 
museographic elements that allow visitors to appreciate the natural history of our 
planet as a true work of art and that allow to generate awareness for the conservation 
of our environment. <br>
Fossils and reconstructions of all three prehistoric animals depicted on the stamps 
were on show in the exhibition.<br>

<strong><em>Coahuilaceratops magnacuerna</em></strong> is a species of herbivorous ceratopsian dinosaur.  <br>

The dinosaur lived during the Late Cretaceous 
(late Campanian Stage - 72.5 to 71.4 million years ago) in what is now 
southern Coahuila in northern Mexico, as can be recognized 
from the first portion of the generic name (<em><strong>Coahuila</strong>ceratops</em>). <br>
The second part of the name, “ceratops,” is Greek for “horned face.” <br>
The specific name magnacuerna combines the Latin word “magna,” meaning “great,” with the Spanish “cuerna,”
 meaning “horn,” in reference to the very large supraorbital horncores of this taxon. <br>
 <br>

Fossils of the dinosaur were discovered in 2001 by school teacher and amateur 
paleontologist Claudio de Leon Davila.
De Leon Davila discovered the bones while looking for fossils in the Cerro del Pueblo Formation 
in the Ejido Porvenir de Jalpa, General Cepeda, Coahuila. <br>

In 2003 the team from the Utah Museum of Natural History (USA), 
the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology (Canada) 
and the Desert Museum (Mexico), uncovered fossils of two <em>Coahuilaceratops</em> specimens - 
one adult and a juvenile, as well as fish, turtles, crocodiles, lizard, snakes, and 
mosasaurs, together with dinosaur eggshells and abundant trackways.  <br>
The fossils of <em>Coahuilaceratops</em> were prepared at the Utah Museum of Natural History, requiring two years 
of meticulous work by skilled volunteer preparator Jerry Golden.

<!-- 
The adult fossil consists of disarticulated elements that include the rostral, 
 left premaxilla, right maxilla, fused nasals, partial left and right supraorbital horncores, 
 part of the parietosquamosal frill, both dentaries, and postcranial elements (not yet prepared). 

 The juvenile (CPC 277) consists of a predentary, dentary, and unprepared postcranial elements 
 that also remain unprepared. 
-->


<br>
The dinosaur was formally described in 2010 by the team of international scientists 
led by Mark A. Loewen from the Utah Museum of Natural History (USA). 
It was the first horned dinosaur from Mexico and one of the first dinosaurs from the 
country to be named. 
In one of his interviews  Mark Loewen said: 
"We know very little about the dinosaurs of Mexico, and this find increases 
immeasurably our knowledge of the dinosaurs living in Mexico during the Late Cretaceous" 
<br>

<br>
Although based on incomplete remains, <em>Coahuilaceratops</em> is thought to 
possess among the largest horns of any dinosaur currently known. 
The supraorbital horns are about a meter long, the biggest known so far for a 
ceratopsian, and the skull is estimated to have been about 1.8 m long. <br>

Even though such horns are common features of ceratopsid dinosaurs, those of 
<em>Coahuilaceratops</em> appear to be the largest known for the group, exceeding 
the size of eye horns even in <em>Triceratops</em>.
Like other horned dinosaurs, <em>Coahuilaceratops</em> probably 
used its headgear to attract mates and fight with rivals of the same species. <br>

<em>Coahuilaceratops</em> specimens are permanently housed in the collections of the Museum of the Desert.  
Casts of the fossils are available in the collections of the Utah Museum of Natural History 
in Salt Lake City (USA).

<em>Coahuilaceratops</em>, a rhino-sized creature, 
has an approximate length of 6.7 meters and weighed between 4 and 5 tons. <br>

Mark Loewen described the arid, desert terrain where the dinosaur was recovered as 
nothing like Mexico during the Late Cretaceous. 
About 72 million years ago, the region was a humid estuary with lush vegetation, 
an area where salt water from the ocean mixed with fresh water from rivers, much like 
the modern Gulf Coast of the south-eastern <a href="../../country/usa.html">United States</a>. 
Many dinosaur bones in the area are covered with fossilized snails and marine clams, 
indicating that the dinosaurs inhabited environments adjacent to the seashore.
<br>
The rocks in which <em>Coahuilaceratops</em> was found also contain large fossil 
deposits of jumbled duck-bill dinosaur skeletons. 
These sites appear to represent mass death events, perhaps associated with storms 
such as hurricanes that occur in the region today. <br>

<strong><em>Aquilolamna</em></strong> is an extinct genus of shark-like elasmobranch 
from the Late Cretaceous (Turonian)-aged Agua Nueva Formation of Mexico. <br>

It is currently known to contain only one species, <em>Aquilolamna milarcae</em>, 
also known as the eagle shark, and it is classified in its own family <em>Aquilolamnidae</em>, 
which has been tentatively assigned to the mackerel sharks. <br>
<br>

The 93 million year old fossil was described from a single extremely well-preserved 
specimen, containing a fully-preserved skeleton and potential skin impressions, 
recovered in 2012 by an unknown quarry worker in Vallecillo in the Mexican state of 
Nuevo Leon. 
The specimen came to the attention of local teacher Margarito González González, 
who collected and prepared the specimen. <br>
Over the coming years, it received increasing attention at paleontological conferences, 
and was finally described in 2021 by a European-Mexican paleontological team, 
including Dr. Romain Vullo from University Rennes in France 
and Prof. Dr Wolfgang Stinnesbeck from Heidelberg University in Germany. <br>

Other scientists involved, besides Prof. Stinnesbeck and his team, were from the 
universities of Rennes (France) and Bonn, 
the Jura Museum Eichstätt of the Bavarian Natural History Collections, 
the State Museum of Natural History Karlsruhe and the Museo del Desierto in Mexico. 
The project was funded by the German Research Foundation. 
The results were published in the journal “Science”. <br>

<p>
	Dr. Vullo explained: <br>
	"The complete specimen was found in 2012 in Vallecillo, Mexico, a locality yielding 
	remarkably preserved fossils.
	This site, already famous for its many fossils of ammonites, bony fish and other 
	marine reptiles, is most useful for documenting the evolution of oceanic animals.
	My first thoughts on seeing the fossil were that this unique morphology is 
	totally new and unknown among sharks.
	Standing out among both living and fossil planktivorous (plankton-eating) sharks 
	and rays, <em>Aquilolamna milarcae</em> resides somewhere in-between."
</p>

<br>
<em>Aquilolamna</em> displays an array of extremely unusual adaptations that make it 
unlike any living or extinct species of shark. <br>
It had a torpedo-shaped body and tail similar to that of most sharks, 
but also had a pair of extremely long, winglike pectoral fins.
These fins with width 1.90 meters from tip to tip were wider than it was 
long - 1.65 meters. <br>

Another notable feature of <em>Aquilolamna</em> is its apparent lack of dorsal 
and pelvic fins.
These, combined with its broad head, have led to the hypothesis that 
<em>Aquilolamna</em> was a planktivorous filter-feeder, similar to manta rays. <br>
Even though this fish likely fed by sifting plankton or other small morsels from the 
water column, it may have had tiny, pointed teeth similar to modern filter-feeding 
sharks such as the basking shark and megamouth. 
These teeth can be used to determine the evolutionary relationships of these sharks, 
but none were found to date.

<br>
Unlike manta rays, which "fly" through the water by flapping their fins, 
<em>Aquilolamna</em> may have instead steadily "glided", slowly, through the water 
with the help of its slender pectoral fins, and propelled itself with its tail. <br>

<strong><em>Acantholipan gonzalezi</em></strong> is a species of ankylosaurian dinosaur (<em>Nodosauridae</em> family) from 
Mexico from the early Santonian age of the Late Cretaceous. 
<em>Acantholipan gonzalezi</em> is on the logo of the Desert Museum, and was also 
selected as the motif for the First-Day-of-Issue Postmark. <br>

<br>
Isolated bones and osteoderms of ankylosaurian dinosaurs were discovered 
from Late Cretaceous sediments of northern Coahuila, northeastern Mexico. 
They have been identified as remains of nodosaurids and were described and named in 2011.
It seems to be a juvenile because of its measurements.
It's 3.5 metres long and weighs more than half a ton.
<br>
<br>
The generic name combines the Greek akanthos, "spine", with lipan, the usual Spanish 
designation of the <span lang="sp">Lépai-Ndé</span>, the "Gray People", a tribe of 
the Apache inhabiting the area where the fossils were found. <br>
The specific name honours the Mexican paleontologist <span lang="sp">Arturo Homero González-González</span>, 
the chairman of the Desert Museum (Museo del Desierto at Saltillo).
<em>Acantholipan gonzalezi</em> is the first named ankylosaur from Mexico.  <br> 
The dinosaur lived 85 million years ago, making it the oldest dinosaur to have inhabited the region.

A replica of the prehistoric animal is on display at the museum which also features 
the most important collection of dinosaur bones, including the one we all know, the 
<em>Tyrannosaurus Rex</em>. <br>
