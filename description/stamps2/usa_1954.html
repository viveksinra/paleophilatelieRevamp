<p align="left">If
you were a guest at
Thomas Jefferson's home at Monticello, you could see things that
revealed the intellectual range of this remarkable Founding Father. The
house, designed by Jefferson himself, was perhaps the most beautiful
building in the new republic and inside it was the nation's greatest
library. Throughout the building's public spaces you would see images
and statues of major politicians and philosophers. And in the entry
hall more a museum than anything else you could examine a
variety
of natural history and ethnographic specimens, including some from the
Lewis and Clark Expedition. Among these displays were fossils of an
impressive giant, the American mastodon.<br>
mastodon tooth</p>
<p align="left">Jefferson
is rightfully renowned as the principal author of the Declaration of
Independence, the Third President of the United States, and a champion
of Liberty. But he was also a central player in the
beginnings of American paleontology. In addition, his
participation occurred at a time when people were struggling with the
ideas of fossils as evidence of past life, of extinction, and of an
Earth far older than the Biblical account.</p>
<p align="left">Some
of the fruits of Jefferson's paleontology became part of the
collections at the American Philosophical Society in Philadelphia.
Beginning in 1849 these holdings were transferred over to the <a href="usa_1955.html">Academy of Natural Sciences of
Philadelphia</a>, where they are currently housed. This is the
Thomas Jefferson Fossil Collection.</p>
<ul>
<li>The American
Mastodon is the most important species in this collection. The identity
and nature of this mysterious creature captured the interest and
imagination of people in both Europe and North America. </li>
<li>The Giant Claw, or Megalonyx,
was the
subject of the first scientific papers in American paleontology. </li>
<li>
Six Other Fossil animals
are also part of this collection:
Ancient Bison (Bison antiquus), Ancient Horse (Equus cf. E.
complicatus), Harlan's Musk Ox (Bootherium bombifrons), Megalodon Shark
(Carcharocles megalodon), Stag Moose (Cervalces scotti), Woolly Mammoth
(Mammuthus primigenius).
</li>
<li>Next to the American Mastodon, Jefferson's Ground Sloth is
the most important fossil animal represented in the Thomas Jefferson
Fossil Collection. This unusual animal was the subject of the first and
second scientific articles on fossils ever published in the United
States. </li>
</ul>

<p align="left">In
March of 1797, Jefferson arrived in Philadelphia to attend the
inauguration of John Adams as president and himself as vice president.
However, his heart and mind may very well been more invested in a talk
he would soon give at the American Philosophical Society. He had just
been elected president of the society and almost certainly preferred
the company of its members to the cabinet of his political rival, Mr.
Adams .<br>
</p>

<p align="left">The
subject of Jefferson' s talk before the society was a collection of
remarkable bones he received from a cave in what is now West Virginia.
The bones were discovered while workmen were mining saltpeter (sodium
nitrate) from the cave floor. Many of the bones had been taken by
locals as souvenirs, but a few of them were salvaged by John Stewart
and sent to his friend at Monticello.</p><table align="left" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="4" width="10%">

At the talk on March 10, Jefferson described the bones, which consisted
of a fragment of the upper arm, the two bones of the lower arm and
parts of the hand. Menacing claws at the end of each finger, prompting
Jefferson to name the animal "Megalonyx" or "Great-Claw". He concluded
that these fossils belonged to a large cat such as a lion or tiger. But
they were too large to belong to any known cat. Using the anatomical
account of the African lion by the French anatomist Daubenton for
comparison, Jefferson estimated that the Megalonyx weighed more than
three times the weight of the lion. He concluded:
<p align="left">"Let
us say then, what we may safely say, that he was more than three times
as large as the lion: that he stood as pre-eminently at the head of the
column of clawed animals as the mammoth stood at that of the elephant,
rhinoceros and hippopotamus: and than he may have been as formidable an
antagonist to the mammoth as the lion to the elephant."</p>
<p class="quote">An
unexpected thing happened to Jefferson before he was to present the
talk on Megalonyx (=Great Claw). He had been browsing a Philadelphia
bookstore when he chanced upon an article in the British publication
Monthly
Magazine. It contained a short abstract and illustration
based on a 1796 publication by Georges Cuvier on a giant, clawed fossil
from Paraguay. The fossil, which was essentially a complete skeleton,
belonged to an unknown animal that was clearly related to the South
American tree sloths. Cuvier had named this creature Megatherium.

<p class="quote">Confronted with the possibility that his
"lion"
may in fact be a relative of the sloth, Jefferson hastily appended a
postscript to his talk. He acknowledged that Megalonyx could, in fact,
be Megatherium . On the other hand, Jefferson
was skeptical that the two were identical. He remarked that the
magazine article's illustration "is not so done as to be relied on, and
the account is only an abstract". Moreover, he commented, "having
nothing of our animal but the leg and foot bones, we have few points
for a comparison between them." Jefferson acknowledged that the limb
bones resembled each other but he still reserved judgment. After all,
Cuvier's identification of Megatherium as a
relative of the sloth was based primarily on its teeth. Jefferson
concluded: "But to solve satisfactorily the question of identity, the
discovery of fore-teeth, or of a jaw bone shewing it had, or had not,
such teeth, must be waited for, and hoped with patience. I may be
better in the mean time, to keep up the difference of name."</p>
