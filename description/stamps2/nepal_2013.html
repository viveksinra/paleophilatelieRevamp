On December 31<sup>st</sup>, 2013, the Post Authority of Nepal announced the set of 4 stamps
"Fossils of Nepal" showing some fossils and reconstructions of prehistoric animals who
lived on the territory of the country in the past.

	<p class="notes">
		These stamps are declared on this day, but arrived at the post offices of Nepal 
		much later, as they were printed abroad, in Spring 2014, 
		even though FDC were cancelled with postmark dated 31.12.2013. 
		The Natural History Museum of Nepal issued their commemorative covers, cancelled 
		on May 18<sup>th</sup>, 2014, in GPO of Kathmandu. 
	</p>

Fossils of these animals were discovered in various areas of Nepal and are in the collection 
of the Natural History Museum of Nepal. 
Dr. Ramesh Shrestha, Chief of the Natural History Museum worked closely 
with the designer of the stamps and  Nepal's Post Authority to create these stamps. <br>

<p class="notes">
	Dr. Ramesh Shrestha was appointed as Chief of the Natural History Museum 
	under the Institute of Science and Technology (IOST) in June 2013.
	Previously Dr. Shrestha worked at the Central Department of Zoology in Kirtipur, 
	for more than two decades, where he taught Evolutionary Biology, 
	Biogeography and Climatology.	<br>
	Dr. Shrestha saw the huge collection of natural objects at the museum and 
	determined that there was great potential to do a lot of work and research.
	He also wanted popularize the study of Natural history by young people in Nepal, 
	therefore he came up with the idea to issue some postage stamps showing objects 
	(not only fossils) from the collection of the museum. <br>
	Rajman Man Maharjan, the artist of the museum created  
	<a href="../../images/details/stamps/official/nepal/sketeches_of_rajan_maharjan.jpg">sketches 
	with reconstructions of prehistoric animals</a>, based on fossils from the collection 
	of the museum.
	Four sketches were sent by Dr. Shrestha to the Postal Service Department of Nepal with 
	the request to use the logo of the Natural History Museum on every stamp.
</p> 

These stamps were the first Natural History Museum stamp series of Nepal. 
<br>
On May 18<sup>th</sup>, 2014, to commemorate the issue, the Natural History Museum 
organized a special event "First Natural History Museum Stamps: Fossils of Nepal".
Many honourable guests from the Institute of Science and Technology and 
the Postal Administration attended. 
During this event the museum presented their 
<a href="#ccovers">commemorative covers</a> cancelled with unique <a href="#pm">postmarks</a>. <br>


<br>
Several stamp series, which show various objects from the Museum collection, were issued 
in the following years. <br>
These stamps were printed on Security Stamp paper UV dull with visible &amp; 
invisible fibers &amp; phosphorescent dots. <br>


<br>
<strong>The Natural History Museum of Nepal</strong> is situated on the lap of 
Swayambhu Stupa, a world heritage site in the west hillock of Kathmandu Valley. 
Swayambhu Hillock is itself a famous place not only in the context of the culture, 
religion and history of Kathmandu valley, but also equally famous place for 
the early plant hunters in Nepal. <br>

The mission of the Natural History Museum, Tribhuvan University is to
inspire natural science research of national/international significance; 
to serve a research and educational facilities with timely environmental 
information relating natural history to present-day environmental and cultural 
issues for both Nepali and foreign researchers; to connect the Nepali people with their own
country's natural history, and to deliver an urgent message that the
Nepalese themselves are trustees of this fragile natural heritage; 
to promote understanding of the evolution and diversity of flora and fauna of Nepal. <br>

<br>
<a name="museum"></a>
The museum was established in 1975. 
Since then, the museum has collected 50.000 specimens of Nepal’s modern and prehistoric
flora and fauna. 
The museum also have some relics from the country's prehistoric times. 
There is a fossilized skull of the <em>Archidiskodon</em>, a species of elephant that roamed 
the Sivalik Hills of Nepal.
Another ancient specimen is the molar teeth of <em>Sivapithecus</em>, a hominoid.
The skull and the teeth are believed to be around 3 million years and 8-10 million years
old respectively. 
Fossils of all animals are depicting on stamps bellow are from collection of the museum. <br>

The genus of <em>Giraffids</em> evolved from a group of even toed ungulates in the early Miocene almost 25
million years ago. <br>
The extinct <em>Giraffa punjabiensis</em> inhabited large parts of Eurasia including the ancient land 
of Nepal and eventually spread into Africa. 
Fossil records indicate many other giraffids thrived between the Miocene Era (around 20 million years ago) 
and the recent past.<br>
They formed part of a relatively late mammal diversification that also produced cattle, antelopes, and deer
following a climate change that transformed subtropical woodlands into open savannah grasslands. <br>
The descendants of the <em>Giraffa punjabiensis</em> species form parts of a relatively late mammal diversification that
also produced cattle, antelopes, and deer following a climate change that transformed subtropical woodlands 
into open ruminant artiodactyls mammals that share a common ancestor with deer and bovid.  <br>
The biological family, once a diverse group spread throughout Eurasia and Africa, contains only two living members, 
the giraffe and the okapi.<br>
The molar teeth of this extinct Giraffe were found at the Surai Khola Formation in Nepal.<br>

<br>
<a name="elephant"></a>
Extinct Elephant - <strong><em>Archidiskidon planifrons</em></strong> <br>
The stamp show reconstruction of the elephant and its skull with partial tusks
and teeth, estimated 3 million years ago, from the collection of the Natural History Museum. <br>

<em>Archidiskidon planifrons</em> is a type of a genus <em>Stegodon</em> of the extinct 
subfamily <em>Stegodontinae</em> of the order <em>Proboscidea</em>.  <br>
While tracing the biogeography of these animals they were found to live in large parts of 
Asia during the Pleistocene, Pliocene and the Holocene epochs. <br>
Interestingly, these animals were also found in the then ancient lands of present day Nepal. 
Like their modern relatives, <em>Archidiskidon</em> were quite large. <br>
The largest known species reached height in the region of 4 meters at the shoulder and
weighed up to 8 tones, while exceptionally large males may have exceeded 12 tones. 
However, most species of <em>Archidiskidon</em> were only about as large as a modern Asia elephant 
(which are about 2.5 meters to 3 meters high at the shoulder). <br>
Both sexes of <em>Archidiskidon</em> bore tusks. 
A definitive explanation for their extinction has yet to be agreed upon.
The warming trend (Holocene) that occurred 12,000 years ago could have contributed to 
their process of extinction. 
Many forests replaced open woodlands and grasslands also, which contributed in the reduction of
their habitats. <br>
Many fossilized body parts of these elephants were recorded from different parts of Nepal. 
There is a fossilized skull of the <em>Archidiskidon</em> were discovered on the banks of Ratua Khola 
river in the collection of Natural History Museum. 
The present stamp shows the image of <em>Archidiskidon planifrons</em> and the completed skull with its tusks.<br>

<em>Ramapithecus sivalensis</em> (Synonym= <em>Sivapithecus punjsbiensis</em>) is a species 
of an extinct primate. 
Fossil remains of this animal, dated from 12.5 million to 8.5 million years old in the Miocene, 
have been found in the Siwalik Hills of Nepal and other adjoining areas. 
The molar teeth of the ancient hominoid, <em>Ramapithecus</em>, was
discovered in Tinau Khola on way to Tansen from Butawal in 1932 by G. Edward Lewis. 
The finding has been a great landmark to know about the distribution of Late Miocene hominoids 
in south Asia.<br>
During that time it was claimed that the jaw was more like a human jaw. <br>
<em>Ramapithecus</em> was understood to have direct ancestral roots to modern humans. 
Meanwhile, more complete specimens of <em>Ramapithecus</em> were found in 1975 and 1976, which showed 
that it was less human-like than had been thought before. 
It began to look more and more like better <em>Sivapithecus</em> instead of <em>Ramapithecus</em>. 
The analysis of the original <em>Ramapithecus</em> fossils had errors directing them as ancestors of modern
humans. <br>
In 1982, David Pilbeam published a description of a significant fossil find if a large part of 
the face and jaw of <em>Sivapithecus</em>. 
This specimen bore many similarities to the Orang-utan skull and with the help of more modern tools, 
it strengthened the theory of <em>Sivapithecus</em> (<em>Ramapithecus</em>) being closely related 
to Orang-utan than human beings.<br>
Today it is believed that the fossils attributed to <em>Ramapithecus</em> actually represent the slightly 
smaller females of <em>Sivapithecus</em>. 
So, neither <em>Ramapithecus</em> nor <em>Sivapithecus</em> was direct <em>Homo sapiens</em> 
(present day human beings) ancestor. <br>

Extinct Hippopotamus - <strong><em>Hexaprotodon sivalensis</em></strong><br>

<em>Hexaprotodon sivalensis</em> is an extinct hippopotamus species. <br>
It lived during the Pliocene and the Pleistocene (5.33 to 0.11 million years ago). 
Fossils of this species have been found in 
<a href="../../country/indonesia.html">Indonesia</a>, 
<a href="../../country/india.html">India</a>, 
<a href="../../country/sri_lanka.html">Sri Lanka</a>, and 
<a href="../../country/nepal.html">Nepal</a>.  <br>
It was obviously a very widely distributed creature.
The height of <em>Hexaprotodon</em> is estimated to have been about 75 cm. and it is thought to
have weight around 180 kg. 
The size of <em>Hexaprotodon</em> was comparable to that of the living pygmy hippopotamus of 
<a href="../../country/madagascar.html">Madagascar</a>. <br>
There are few species of Hippos that have become extinct over time. 
It is believed that they were around until about 1,000 years ago. 
The overall size of them was smaller than the Hippos we are familiar with today. 
It is believed that they were smaller as a way of surviving in their environment. <br>
The European Hippo is also extinct but it was once found throughout Europe as well as the British Isles. 
It is believed that they became extinct before the last glaciations period. 
These Hippos were much larger than those we know about today. <br>
In Nepal the fossils of <em>Hexaprotodon sivalensis</em> have been discovered at Gidniya Village and Rato Khola.<br>
The skull and lower jaw of this extinct hippopotamus is one of the appealing items in the collection of
Natural History Museum. 
The present stamp shows the image of <em>Hexaprotodon sivalensis</em> and the complete skull and lower jaws.
