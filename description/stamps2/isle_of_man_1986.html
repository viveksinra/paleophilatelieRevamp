On February 2<sup>nd</sup>, 1986, the Post Authority of Isle of Man issued a set 
of 5 stamps to commemorate 100<sup>th</sup> anniversary of "The Manx Museum"<br>

<p class="notes">
	The Manx Museum is the treasure-house of
	the Manx people and the headquarters of the Manx National Trust and of
	the branch museums at Castletown (Nautical Museum), Cregneash (Village
	Folk Museum), and Ramsey (Rural Life Museum).<br>
	Totally distinctive in character, it is devoted to the Isle of Man in
	all its aspects and extends from prehistoric times right up to the
	present day. In 1986 ISLE 0F MAN POST OFFICE commemorate the Centenary
	of the Manx Museum and Ancient Monuments Act (1886) by which Tynwald,
	the Island's Parliament, recognised the need for official preservation
	of the Island's history.
	<br>
	In 1922 the early work of the Manx Museum
	Trustees was centralised by the provision of land and buildings,
	through the generosity of the Trustees of the late Henry Bloom Noble, a
	wealthy Manx philanthropist. Since that time, extensions and
	development have increased the public and records areas. A new Art
	Gallery and Library were opened in 1936, a Natural History Gallery in
	1937, and in 1960 further space was provided for the Museum's Library
	and Archives. The latter holds an unrivalled collection of Manx public
	records, private archives, newspapers, photographs. prints and maps, as
	well as printed books of Manx and general reference.

<p> One stamp from the set, with face value of 	22p, depicts a skeleton of 
	"<strong>The Great Deer</strong>"  (<em>Megaloceros giganteus</em>). 
    These animals were inhabitants of Man at the close of the Great Ice Age
    and became extinct in prehistoric times. 
</p>

<em>Megaloceros giganteus</em>, also known as "Giant Deer" or "Irish Elk" 
(even though it is not an elk, nor it unique to Ireland). <br>
This deer, contemporary of the Mammoth and wooly Rhinoceros, was indeed a Giant, 
as males were up to 700 kg in weight and stood about 2.1 meters tall at the shoulders. 
They carried proportionally huge antlers with a maximum tip to tip length of 3.65 meters.
<br> 
The antlers were up to 50 kg in weight, which are the largest antlers of any known deer. 
Similar to modern deer, the female animals were smaller and antlerless, while males 
replaced their antlers every mating season. 
<br>
According to the recent research <em>Megaloceros giganteus</em>,  most closely 
related to the living fallow deer (<em>Dama dama</em>).
<br>  
They lived during the Pleistocene Epoch, between 2.6 million years ago and 11,700 years 
ago in in Europe and Asia.
A small population of <em>Megaloceros giganteus</em> survived in the Siberian region 
of Russia until 7,000 years ago (probably even to more recent time).
<br>

<br>
The very first, nearly, complete skeleton of <em>Megaloceros giganteus</em> in the 
world was found not in Ireland, but on the Isle of Man.<br>
It was in 1819 when a man called Thomas Kewish discovered it in a marl pit 
(by "marl” is usually meant an open-water mud rich in calcium carbonate deposited  
principally by the plant Chara. 
Such a mud gives clear evidence of the former existence of a lake in whose 
calcium-rich deposits bone would be readily preserved) at Loughan Ruy,  
a basin on the Ballaugh gravel fan, Isle of Man.<br> 
Only a few bones are missing in the skeleton, most notably the pelvis. 
Kewish used a large horse pelvis, among a few other things, to fill in the gaps. 
Kewish entered into a partnership with James Taubman, the tenant of the field where  
the fossils came from.  
They placed the mounted skeleton on display and charged admission to view it.<br>
The Duke of Athol, who was the Queen’s Representative on the Isle of Man, later 
claimed the fossils as Lord of the Manor.  
After a lawsuit, the elk came into the Duke’s possession.<br> 
The Duke of Athol later gave the specimen to the Museum of the University of Edinburg.   
The Elk was later transferred with other specimens to the National Museum of Scotland  
on Chambers St, Edinburgh.
<br>
As it was the first skeleton of <em>Megaloceros giganteus</em> its drawing appeared 
in many scientific essay and books. <br>

Today it is required to have an export license  to remove Giant Deer bones from the 
Island, but it is almost impossible to obtain one. <br>

 <br>
The only other skeleton of <em>Megaloceros giganteus</em> found on the Isle of Man, 
to date, is the one shown on the stamp, was excavated at Close-y-Garey, St. John's 
in 1897,  as the result of an intensive search for a complete specimen by the 
'Elk Committee' led by P.M.C. Kermode, who later became the Manx Museum's first Curator.
The skeleton is almost complete; the back of the skull and tail were missing at the 
time of excavation and have been replaced by modelled plaster. 
Two large neck bones were also missing and the gap filled by Irish bones supplied 
by the British Museum.<br>
This skeleton is 1.7 metres tall at the shoulder, with an antler span of over 2.6 metres.<br>  
It was originally displayed in the temporary museum at Castle Rushen in 1905 before being 
transported to the Manx museum in the 1950s.

The collection of <em>Megaloceros giganteus</em> bone in the "Manx Museum" of 
Isle of Man is no way near as extensive as the one in Dublin, 
but bones turn up fairly regularly on the north-west coast and we have a few 
nice pieces, as it happened in the Spring of 2018 for example: <br>

			<strong>12p value - Viking Necklace.</strong><br>
			 Peel Castle offers rich testimony to the
			vicissitudes of Manx history through the centuries, from the early
			Celtic inhabitants through the age of Viking supremacy to the Stanley
			period. Since 1982, careful excavations, initiated by the Manx Museum
			and now supported by St. Patrick's Isle (Isle of Man) Archeological
			Trust, have revealed many treasures from the past, and give promise of
			valuable and exciting discoveries in the future. This spectacular
			necklace, originally consisting of over 60 glass and amber beads, was
			found with other household goods in the Pagan Lady's Grave - the first
			female Viking grave discovered in the Isle of Man.</td>

		<td width="50%">
			<strong>15p value - Meayll Circle.</strong><br>
			 This megalithic chambered tomb is of a
			unique design. It consists of 6 pairs of burial chambers arrayed in a
			circle, with a passage leading inwards to the junction of each pair.
			First recorded in 1863 and first excavated in 1893, it is believed to
			date from the New Stone Age, around 2,000 BC.

			<strong>26p value - Viking Longship.</strong><br> 
			The arrival
			of early Viking raiders and their subsequent settlement made an
			enormous impact on the Isle of Man. This large-scale model, now on
			display in the Museum, was specially constructed in Norway in 1939 and
			is a faithful reproduction of the famous ship discovered at Gokstad,
			Norway, in 1880.
			<br><br>

		<td width="50%">
			<strong>29p value - Cregneash.</strong><br>
		    This village,
			preserved as a monument to the activities and environment of Manx
			people in bygone years, was the first publicly-owned open-air Folk
			Museum in the British Isles. The original buildings, some furnished as
			dwellings and others bearing evidence of traditional crafts, faithfully
			reflect the lifestyle of one of the last strongholds of Manx custom and
			tradition.</td>
