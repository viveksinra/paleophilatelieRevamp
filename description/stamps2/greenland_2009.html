On January 19<sup>th</sup>, 2009, the Post Authority of Greenland issued the 
second of two stamp sets "Fossils of Greenland".
<a href="greenland_2008.html">The first set</a> was issued in the previous year. <br>
The illustrations and the engravings are made by the Norwegian

<q>This is the second and final part of Post Greenland’s series about fossils 
in Greenland and consists of three stamps demonstrating aspects of the extensive and 
exciting fossil record of Greenland. <br>
The second group of images  continues our journey through some of the key events 
in the history of life on our planet, beautifully illustrated by yet more unique fossils. <br>
These  three fossils, a plant, an invertebrate and a vertebrate, are from the younger 
part of the fossil record, ranging from about 200 million to just some 8,000 years ago.<br>
<br>

<strong><em>Schizoneura carcinoides</em></strong>. <br>
 One  of the five big mass extinction events occurred  some 200 million years ago at 
 the boundary between the Triassic and Jurassic systems. 
 Beautifully-preserved plant fossils have been known for many  years from Jameson Land 
 in East Greenland derived from ancient forests that survived  this extinction event. 
 The horsetail <em>Schizoneura carcinoides</em>, with its distinctive spiky leaves, 
 grew in marshes and if present in sufficient numbers could generate coal. 
 In East Greenland these plants were common near Scoresby Sound and were first described over 70 years ago. 
 Now they are helping scientists assess climate change during the mass extinction event. <br>

 title="Fossil of Scaphites rosenkrantzi on stamp of Greenland 2009"></a>
 
 <strong><em>Scaphites rosenkrantzi</em></strong><br>
 The end of the Cretaceous extinction, 65 million years ago, is better known since it is linked to a 
  massive environmental catastrophe associated with the impact of a giant asteroid and 
  major volcanic eruptions. 
  During this period the dinosaurs and various types of giant marine reptiles, such as the mosasaurs and 
  plesiosaurs, disappeared from Earth forever.  <br> 
  Another fossil group, the ammonites, similar to modern nautilus, 
  became almost extinct with possibly only a couple of stragglers surviving into the Tertiary. 
  During the later Cretaceous, however, the ammonites began to develop some fascinating and 
  unusual shell shapes. 
  <em>Scaphites rosenkrantzi</em> from the Cretaceous rocks of Nussuaq, West Greenland is 
  a spectacular example, where the coiled shell of the animal has started to unravel. 
  Despite its strange shape it could undoubtedly maintain its buoyancy in the water and probably swam quite 
  fast. <br>
<br>

title="Fossil of Mallotus villosus on stamp of Greenland 2009"
alt="Fossil of Mallotus villosus on stamp of Greenland 2009"></a>
	
<strong><em>Mallotus  villosus</em></strong> or the capelin is a small smelly fish, 
common today in the Arctic seas, prized for its roe but also as a base for fish meal. 
The capelin, however, is also found as  fossils in the Quaternary sediments of West Greenland, 
some nearly 8,000 years old, appearing identical to its living relatives. 
These fossils were brought to the  attention of scientists in Europe more than 200 years ago by 
whalers, who probably collected them from localities such as the head of 
Sondre Stormfjord,  where they are still common today. </q>
