In March 2015, the Marshall Islands Postal Service introduced at their on-line store 
the set of four stamps showing "Dinosaur Bones", while the official issue day 
was announced as January 15<sup>th</sup>, 2015.
The stamps were printed in a sheet of five strips.<br>

<br>
These stamps designs were based on the artworks created by Bryan Kneale, who painted the 
set of six images "Dinosaur Bones" in 1990.
Kneale's paintings were originally published on the cachets of Fleetwood's First Day Cover for the
"<a href="uk_1991.html">150th Anniversary of Dinosaurs' Identification by Sir Richard Owens</a>" 
stamps of the Royal Mail in 1991. <br>

<p>
	Bryan Kneale was born in 1930 on the Isle of Man and attended Douglas School of Art (1946-47)
	and the Royal Academy Schools, London (1948-1949). 
	Kneale was initially a figurative painter, but started making sculpture after attending a
	welding course in 1960. 
	Since the mid-1980s Kneale's major 	source of inspiration has been the skeletons 
	and joints of animals he 	studied and drew at the Natural History Museum in London. 
	In an interview to "Tate" website, Kneale related his fascination to a sculptural
	interest in structure and form: <br>
	<em><q>I have always found in all my work it
	is the connections, the articulation of form which has been of
	particular importance to me, rather than the development of sculptural 	mass. 
	The endless invention in nature of bony structures from minute 	tiny insects 
	and animals to colossal forms of <strong>dinosaur bones</strong> …  has always fascinated me.</q></em>

Between 1989 and 2018 the Marshall Islands outsource the production of their 
stamps to the USA-based company, Unicover Corporation (discontinued in 2018).

<p class="notes">
	Unicover Corporation was privately owned, they have had a wide-reaching artwork 
	originals business. 
	Their principal subsidiary, Unicover World Trade Corporation, was markets postage 
	stamps in North America for various postal administrations from around the globe. <br>
	One of the subsidiary companies of Unicover was Fleetwood (acquired by Mystic in 2007).
	Fleetwood was FDC maker company, since 1929, who create unique cachets for their covers, 
	based on the artwork collection of Unicover Corporation.

More than one hundred and forty-five million years ago, giants roamed the tropical expanses 
of a young earth caught in the perpetual summer of the Mesozoic Era. 
From small, chicken-sized creatures to behemoths weighing more than seventy tons, dinosaurs 
existed as stalking carnivores or browsing herbivores, and their titanic clashes as predator 
and prey thundered across the primordial plains. 
Extinct for eons, dinosaurs continue to captivate imaginations and stimulate vital scientific research.<br>
<br>


<br>
<strong><em>Triceratops</em></strong>
lived and died during the Late Cretaceous Period - more than 136
million years ago.

A large bony frill which partially encircled its
neck separated the creature's massive body and elongated head. 
Two long, bony horns measuring more than three feet in length jutted from
its forehead, while another short horn curved slightly up from its snout. 
The weight of its heavy body was borne by stout hind legs and
shorter forelegs, which suggested a bipedal ancestor. 
Paleontologists have estimated that the <em>Triceratops</em> weighed eight to nine tons and
supported its enormous bulk by browsing continuously, for this dinosaur
- like so many others of formidable appearance- was an herbivore.
Its beak-like mouth ripped fibrous vegetation such as palm fronds,
while its teeth sheared through the stringy pulp and chopped it finely
to allow for easy mastication. 
Scientists believe that the <em>Triceratops</em> grazed and travelled in groups or 
herds which provided additional protection from hungry predators such 
as the <em>Tyrannosaurus rex</em>. 
A latecomer to the Age of Dinosaurs, this species was also among the last
of the reptilian giants to become extinct.<br>
<br>




<br>
The late Jurassic Period produced one of the dinosaur era's most
unusual creatures- the <strong><em>Stegosaurus</em></strong>.

	<table align="left" width="300px"   style="margin-right: 20px; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px" >

	</table>

It developed as a biped, but through the eons it reverted to a
quadruped, thus accounting for its high haunches and short forelegs.
Measuring approximately twenty feet in length, the <em>Stegosaurus</em> was
armoured - with two offset rows of large, triangular, horn-covered bony
plates along its back and two pairs of long, pointed bony spikes at the
end of its tail. 
This battle-ready, ponderous body completely dwarfed the creature's comically-small 
head and suggested a pugnacious nature.
But the <em>Stegosaurus</em> was a peaceably-natured dinosaur which grazed on
soft vegetation and counted on its formidable appearance to ward off predators. 
Closer examination of <em>Stegosaurus</em> fossils in the late 1970s
revealed that the bony plates contained a network of canals which
probably contained blood vessels. 
Many scientists now speculate that the vessels served as a convective 
heat-loss system, enabling the dinosaur to control its own body temperature. 
Such startling information suggests that dinosaurs were warm-blooded creatures 
- not cold-blooded like modern reptiles - and add extra dimension to the
continuing quest to explain their mass extinction. <br>
<br>


<br>
<strong><em>Protoceratops</em></strong>
was one of the most primitive species of dinosaur.

A predecessor of later great horned dinosaurs, the <em>Protoceratops</em> was slightly larger
than the modern alligator and probably evolved - like so many other
herbivores - from a bipedal ancestor. 
The <em>Protoceratops</em>' large head was partially encircled by a bony frill which protected 
its vulnerable neck area from a predator's deadly attack, but this dinosaur lacked the
sharp horns which gave its <em>Triceratops</em> descendents their fierce and
combative appearance. 
A beak-like mouth suited its vegetarian diet, but the creature possessed only a few teeth 
in its upper jaw and probably eschewed fibrous palm fronds in favour of tender, easily masticated
shoots. 
The animal's well-developed tail contained long vertical spines, indicating to some researchers 
a partially-aquatic lifestyle.
Like other larger herbivores, the <em>Protoceratops</em> travelled in groups or herds. 
In recent decades, scientists have uncovered more than eighty individual specimens in all 
stages of development - from whole, unbroken eggs complete with intact embryo to older 
animals at the end of their lifecycle. 
These valuable finds - many of them unearthed in <a href="mongolia_2022.html">Mongolia</a> 
- will in time produce priceless additional data on this ancient creature. 
The <em>Protoceratops</em> was one of the Dinosaur Era's first
species and one of science's most fertile sources for paleontologic research.<br>
<br>


<br>
In 1842 British anatomist <a href="../../topics/paleo/paleontologist.html#owen">Sir Richard Owen</a> 
coined the word dinosaur from two Greek words meaning "terrible lizard." 
Although dinosaurs were not lizards, the term aptly applied to the best known and most fearsome
of all dinosaurs - the <strong><em>Tyrannosaurus</em></strong>.

	<table align="left" width="300px"   style="margin-right: 20px; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px" >

Its name meant "tyrant lizard," and this ravenous meat-eater conducted
an unrivalled reign of terror as master of the Mesozoic Era. 
Towering twenty feet above the ground, the <em>Tyrannosaurus</em> possessed an enormous
head and six-inch, dagger-like teeth which slashed into prey with merciless efficiency. 
Its short forelimbs served little function other than grasping objects at close range, 
and the behemoth's long tail acted as a counter-balance for its cumbersome body. 
While the <em>Tyrannosaurus</em> was undoubtedly the most powerful and dangerous dinosaur,
it was also one of the rarest. 
Scientists estimated that one hundred square miles of territory served as the habitat for only one
<em>Tyrannosaurus</em>. 
Its remains are generally uncovered in the same deposits as the remains of its most likely 
prey - the more plentiful great armoured dinosaurs such as <em>Triceratops</em> and <em>Protoceratops</em>. 
Millions of years after the last <em>Tyrannosaurus</em> died, this terrifying creature
continues to stimulate scientific investigation and linger in the mythological fantasies of mankind.<br>
