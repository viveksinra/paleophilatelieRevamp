On September 21<sup>st</sup>, 2010, the Post Authority of Peru - Servicios Postales del Peru SA (Serpost) - 
continued the series started in 2004, “Prehistoric Animals” (Animales Prehistoricos - Fosiles). 
These stamps show fossils discovered in the country of Peru. <br>
This year the Souvenir-Sheet shows scientific reconstruction and fossils of a prehistoric sloth  - 
<em>Thalassocnus littoralis</em>. <br>
The <a href="../../images/details/stamps/official/peru/2010/Peru_2010_back.jpg">reverse side</a> 
of the Souvenir-Sheet is numbered. <br>

<br>
When you think of marine mammals, sloths are probably the last thing you’d
expect to take to the water. 
But from the Late Miocene (7-8 million years ago) to the Late Pliocene (3-1.5 million years ago), 
several species of giant ground sloths in the genus <em>Thalassocnus</em> 
did indeed evolve to take advantage of the aquatic environment. 
However even some modern sloths can swim. <br>

"If there is something amazing about paleontology it is a capacity to show us that the life on the
Earth, such as we know it nowadays, is the result of constant changes. <br>
Even the English naturalist <a href="../../topics/paleo/contributors.html#darwin">Charles Darwin</a> 
sketched his primordial ideas about the biological evolution inspired by fossilized bones of 
giant sloths and Glyptodonts, the ancestors of little tree sloths and armadillos in South America.
The theory of evolution developed 150 years ago in Darwin’s “The origin of the species” - 
is the concept that integrates all the sciences of life, now with the help of
genetics and molecular biology. 
As in Darwin’s time, fossils are still critical to understanding evolution. <br>

Millions of years ago, the desert area of Sacaco, north to Arequipa, was a littoral marine environment.
In its sands lie hundreds of fossils of whales, dolphins, seals, penguins and
sharks in excellent state of preservation. 
In 1967, French paleontologist Robert Hoffstetter visited the area, and was greatly surprised to find
a terrestrial intruder: a sloth between aquatic species.
It was initially assumed that the sloth lived on land, near the littoral.
Hoffstetter thought that their bodies were transported to the sea by an Andean paleo-river,
where they were buried and preserved with aquatic species. 
However, something was wrong: 
the skeletons were always found articulated and complete, as if buried
in the same place of their death - in the sea. 
What if it really was an aquatic sloth? 
This possibility, though wild, encouraged paleontologists Christian de
Muizon and Greg McDonald to observe every bone's detail to look for
revealing clues. 
In 1995, Muzion and McDonald announced in Nature Magazine, the existence
of a 4-million-year old aquatic sloth in Peru.
Some details of its anatomy, such as the shape of the premaxilla,
femur and caudal vertebrae (the bones that make up the tails of
tailed animals), are more similar to certain aquatic mammals that to others extinct sloths. 
Various scientists were skeptical though.<br>


<br>
After almost 15 years and many discoveries made by Mario Urbina, 5 species of the aquatic sloth
<em>Thalassocnus</em> were described, all of them found in marine deposits nearby Sacaco,
but in rocks belonging to successive epochs from 9 to 2,5 million years ago. <br>

This only record, let us track the first splashes in its linneage evolution, and
also observe the way that certain adaptations to the aquatic environment
were progressively accentuated through time. 
<em>Thalassocnus</em> was a sloth the size of a large dog, with long tail and powerful claws. 
It had simple teeth with no enamel. 
Since the most ancient species (<em>Thalassocnus antiquus</em>) to the most
modern (<em>Thalassocnus yaucensis</em>) several changes were observed, especially an
increase in the length and width of the muzzle’s posterior region, related to
obtaining aquatic grass as a new source of food. 
The radius bone morphology shows substantial differences in the mode of locomotion. 
While <em>Thalassocnus antiquus</em> has a long radius bone with a reduced supinator crest, typical of
terrestrial sloth, in <em>Thalassocnus yaucensis</em> the radius bone is short and the supinator crest is
highly developed as observed in seals and sea lions. 
Today there is no doubt that <em>Thalassocnus</em> was an aquatic sloth which spent a long time feeding into
the sea; but what could have incentivized it to leave  its quiet life on land to
adventure amongst waves infested with sharks? Good question. 
It is known that the Peruvian coast was already arid in that epoch. 
Possibly the scarce vegetation in the coasted desert led to the search for alternative resources 
such as algae exposed during low tide. 
After many generations, some of them ventured into the sea to look for algae and marine grasses.
As this survival strategy was good enough, those individuals who had small anatomical
advantages to live and feed in the sea –therefore the more suitable - had more
opportunities to reproduce and fix their genes in their offspring. 
The mechanism of evolution proposed by Darwin – natural selection - was on the road. <br>


In 2008, more work on these fossils was published in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology. 
This work focused on the first remains of <em>Thalassocnus</em> discovered outside of Sacaco, nearly 1500 km away 
in rocks of marine origin at Bahia Inglesa, in northern <a href="../../country/chile.html">Chile</a>. 
The broadening of the geographic range of these fossils suggests that these animals dominated a vast littoral territory. 
These fossils were also found with whale and dolphin remains. 
Another site where <em>Thalassocnus</em> was found recently, was at Ica, 180 km north of Sacaco. <br>


The evolutionary journey of the aquatic sloth, <em>Thalassocnus</em> ended 2 million years ago. 
The quiet, warm water bays that these animals lived in for millions of years changed to the more agitated seas 
that we find in this area today. 
The wide region of sea grass meadows disappeared and the <em>Thalassocnus</em> lineage went extinct. 
Instead, other terrestrial sloths evolved to become the largest mammals that lived in South America. <br>
