Indonesian Post planned to issue this set of stamps in order to commemorate
125 anniversary Paleoanthropological Institute of Indonesia
exactly on the same date as <a href="../../images/fdc/indonesia_1989_fdc.jpg">for 25 years</a>,
on August 31. 
However, for some reason, the issue was  delayed.
These stamps arrived at post office almost two weeks later, on September 12, 2014<br>
<br>


<a href="../../topics/anthro/index.html"><strong>Paleoanthropology</strong></a>, the
interdisciplinary branch of anthropology 
concerned with the origins and development of early humans. 
It is the study of ancient humans as found in fossil hominid evidence such as 
fossilized bones and footprints.<br>

<br><em>
The following text is based on the text from the brochure included in the FDC
with some notes added by the <a href="../../about.html">author of the website</a>. 
</em><br>
<br>
<!--- -->
Early human fossils were first discovered by mining engineer
B.D. van Rietschoten 
<a href="../../images/details/stamps/official/indonesia/2014/indonesia_2014_2.jpg">in 1889 in the village of Wajak</a>, 
Tulungagung, East lava.
This finding was later recognized as the first ancient human fossil
findings reported from Indonesia. After that, Eugene Dubois
rediscovered ancient human fossils in Wajak village in 1890.<br><br>

<p class="notes">
	<strong>Marie Eugène François Thomas Dubois</strong>
	(28 January 1858 – 16 December 1940), was Dutch paleoanthropologist and geologist. 
	He earned worldwide fame for his discovery of <em>Pithecanthropus erectus</em> 
	(later redesignated <em>Homo erectus</em>), or "Java Man". 
	Although hominid fossils had been found and studied before, Dubois was the first 
	anthropologist to embark upon a purposeful search for them.

<br> From these findings, it was revealed mysteries of ancient human fossils were later
named as <em>Homo wajakensis</em> (man of Wajak). 
<em>Homo wajakensis</em> is classified as a hominid. <br>
<em>Homo wajakensis</em>’ height was about 173 cm and showed characteristics of Mongolia and 
Australid race who lived 40,000 to 25,000 years ago.  <br>

The skull of <em>Homo wajakensis</em> was 1,550 cm3 capacity for the female and 1,650 cm3 
for the male. 
The skull volume exceeds the volume of a modern human skull.<br>
Observing the shape of the skull, <em>Homo wajakensis</em> had a hefty bulge in its forehead
like Australid and flat broad face with prominent cheekbones aside as Mongolid. 
Large eye sockets, but rather low. 
Its nose bone was small, flat and wide nostrils. 
Its palate was large and deep, and greater than Australid, had big teeth but in modern proportions. 
The lower jaw was stocky, strong, and heavy, whereas a weak chin and tilted back. 
From the femur and tibia bone, it can be concluded that <em>Homo wajakensis</em> was
slender and tall.<br>


<em>Homo wajakensis</em> skull had many similarities
with the Australian native skull, Aborigines. 
Therefore, Eugene Dubois suspects that it was included in Australid race. 
<em>Homo wajakensis</em> fossils also has similarities with the human fossil of Niah in Sarawak,
Malaysia, man of Tabon in Palawan, Philippines, and Australid fossils
from South China and South Australia.<br>

<br>
Other archaeological evidence indicates the existence of a cave
dwelling (rock-shelter) which was where the ancient human lived at the time. 
The findings of food debris, as seashells (<em>Gastropoda</em>) and also
animal bones as kitchen waste. 
The archaeological evidence provides information about <em>Homo wajakensis</em> 
where these individuals lived.

On <a href="../../images/details/stamps/official/indonesia/2014/indonesia_2014_1.jpg">the left stamp</a> 
you can see a diorama located in the museum at the Sangiran early man site. 
The diorama includes three persons of a <em>Homo erectus</em> family found at Sangiran area of Indonesia. 
<br>

Excavations at Sangiran from 1936 to 1941 led to the discovery of the first hominid fossil at this site. 
Later, 50 fossils of <em>Meganthropus palaeo</em> and 
<em>Pithecanthropus erectus/Homo erectus</em> were found. 
Inhabited for the past one and a half million years, Sangiran is one of the key sites
for the understanding of human evolution. <br>
Sangiran Early Man Site is situated about 15 kilometers in the north of
Solo town in Central Java, Indonesia, covering an area of 5,600 hectares. 
There is a very significant geological sequence from the upper Pliocene until the end of Middle Pleistocene 
by depicting the human, faunal, and cultural evolutions within the last 2.4 million years. 
The property also yields important archaeological occupation floors dating back to the Lower Pleistocene 
around 1.2 million years ago. 
<br>

Ever since von Koenigswald found flake tools in the Ngebung village in 1934, the site has made an 
immense contribution to the study of evolution over the past million years by illustrating the evolution
of <em>Homo erectus</em>. <br>
<em>Homo erectus</em> is important to the study of the early history of mankind before the
emergence of the modern <em>Homo sapiens</em>. 
Fossils of <em>Homo erectus</em> have been found from time to time in a site covering 8 km by 7 km since 1936 to
the present day.<br>
