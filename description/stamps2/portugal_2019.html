<br>
On April 5<sup>th</sup>, 2019, the Post Authority of Portugal introduced 
the set of 13 stamps "Centenary Museums of Portugal". <br>
Every stamp is dedicated to a different museum of the country.<br> 

<br>
<em>The following text was written by Cristina Cordeiro, published in 
	 the brochure produced by Portuguese Post (CTT) for this issue.</em>
<br>

<br>
"This stamp issue is an integral part of a work dedicated to Portuguese
museological heritage, the first volume of which is now coming to light. 
True guardians of memory, the thirteen century-old museums that
are presented here were all founded between 1772 and 1894, in a
period marked by extraordinary advances, having each one of them its
own story to tell. 
A unique story that distinguishes it from all others. 
A story of resilience marked by the will to thrive in often
adverse circumstances, and which made them repeatedly reinvent
themselves up to the present day. 
Distributed throughout the national territory, on the mainland and on the islands, 
from the coast to the interior, these century-old museums, both public and private, 
act as bridges between the monuments, places and communities that form them. <br>

<!-- 1 -->
<br>
Dating to 1772, the <strong>Natural History Cabinet of the University of Coimbra</strong>
– today the Museum of Science – is the oldest living museum in Portugal. <br>

<!-- 2 -->
<br>
It is the heir to the country's first scientific collections,
gathered by Domingos Vandelli in the Royal Museum and Botanical
Garden of Ajuda, which was founded in 1768 at the behest of the Marquis
of Pombal. <br> 

<!-- 3 -->
<br>
Six decades later, even amidst the siege of Porto, King Pedro IV created 
the Museu Portuense, now the Soares dos Reis National 1833, it was the country's 
first public art museum. <br>

<!-- 4 -->
<br>
In 1851, the Artillery Museum – today the Military Museum – was opened
in the facilities of the former Royal the importance of this military
institution in a century marked by liberal struggles. <br>

<!-- 5 -->
<br>
In 1858, now <strong>Museum of Natural History of Science of Lisbon</strong> 
- MUHNAC – was established in the building of the Royal Nobles, later the Polytechnic School. <br>

<!-- 6 -->
<br>
Around 1860, the Lisbon <strong>Geological Museum</strong>
was opened on the first floor of the Academy of Sciences building
in the heart of Bairro Alto, housing the most complete geological
collection of the country.<br> 

<!-- 7 -->
<br>
In 1864, the Archaeological Museum of Carmo was founded within the Royal Association 
of Portuguese Civil Architects and Archaeologists, to whom King Luis ceded the
management of a convent erected in the 14 by Nun'Álvares Pereira to
mark the victory of Aljubarrota. 
Focused on Natural History, the Azorean Museum – today the Carlos Machado Museum – 
appeared in 1880 on the island of Sao Miguel in the Azores. 
Based in the Santo Andre Convent in Ponta Delgada, it quickly expanded its
collections. <br> 

<!-- 8 -->
<br>
In 1884, the Historical and Ethnographic Museum was founded by the Lisbon Geographical Society. 
Now the Ethnographic Museum of the Lisbon Geographical Society, it tells the story of the
Portuguese presence in Africa, <a href="../../country/india.html">India</a>, 
<a href="../../country/macau.html">Macao</a> and Timor. <br>

<!-- 9 -->
<br>
Following the Ornamental Art Exhibition that had taken place in Lisbon that same
year, the Museum of Fine Arts and Archaeology was created, today
the National Museum of Ancient Art. <br>

<!-- 10 -->
<br>
Months later in 1885, the Martins Sarmento Society, an illustrious cultural institution  
in Guimarães, opened the doors of its Archaeological Museum. <br>

<!-- 11 -->
<br> 
Eight years later, in 1893, Jose Leite de Vasconcellos founded his Ethnographic
Museum, currently the National Museum of Archaeology. 
Today, around 380 thousand pieces make up its collections, which cover a vast
chronological spectrum of almost half a million years. <br> 

<!-- 12 -->
<br>
A year later in 1894, the country witnessed the birth of the
Archaeological and Lapidary Museum of Faro, currently the
Municipal Museum of Faro, a guardian of the heritage of this city of
the Algarve from Roman times to today.  <br> 

<!-- 13 -->
<br>
Also in that year, the Municipal Museum of Figueira da Foz – now the Santos Rocha
Municipal Museum – was created, dedicated to the study of the various
branches of human sciences.  <br> 

<br>
Each of these museums carries a living and dynamic legacy which gives rise 
to new readings every day.
A heritage condensed here in twenty-six images and spanning more than a
century of history." <br>

<strong>Lisbon Geological Museum</strong> (LNEG) <br>

The arrangement of collections, his furniture and interior design
exhibition reflect the XIX century type of museology, one of few that
remain in Europe, which makes it be regarded by experts as a "Museum of Museums". <br>

the palaeontology of vertebrates; 
prehistoric archaeology; 
and mineralogy. <br>
<br>
The "<strog>Paleontology</strong> and Stratigraphy Room"
occupies the largest area of the museum, isolated or in central display cases 
are exhibited more than 2200 specimens of fossils from all ages with representation in 
<a href="../../country/portugal.html">Portugal</a>. <br>
"100 Million Years of History of Lisbon" exhibit of the museum is 
dedicated to the geology of Lisbon, from its oldest formation outcrops of the Late Cretaceous 
to the Quaternary.
Each one of the display cases is dedicated to a certain period of time represented in the Lisbon area, 
exhibiting some of the most representative fossils: corals, bivalves, gastropods, echinoderms, 
cephalopods, reptiles and mammals, as well as some samples of sedimentary and eruptive rocks. <br>

One of the fossils, a <strong>fossil Ammonite</strong> of the genus  <em>Euaspidoceras</em> 
from the Upper Jurassic (50 million years ago), found in Malhao, Loule, is shown on the foreground of 
the "Museu Geologico de Lisboa" stamp.<br>



<br>
<br>
<strong>National Museum of Natural History and Science of the University of Lisbon</strong> (MUHNAC)<br>
<br>
The National Museum of Natural History and Science in Lisbon (MUHNAC), 
is the country's main museum focusing on nature. 
The museum functions under the University of Lisbon. <br>

Its rich collections gathered over more than 250 years, span zoology, anthropology, geology and botany. <br>

This mission is achieved through the valorization of its collections and 
the university heritage, research, organization of exhibitions, conferences 
and other scientific, educational, cultural and leisure activities. <br> 

The museum's recent public designation was awarded in October 2011. 
This incorporated the former National Museum of Natural History and the University of 
Lisbon Science Museum, integrating their collections, the historical buildings of the Polytechnic School, 
the Lisbon Botanical Gardens and, since July 2012, the Lisbon Astronomical Observatory. <br>

The Museum supports research and teaching in the fields of zoology and 
anthropology, botany, mineralogy, geology, <strong>paleontology</strong>, and other natural sciences. <br> 

The Mineralogy, Geology and Paleontology Department preserves and enhances the museum's
mineralogy, geology and paleontology collections, promoting its use in
advanced research and training, and in educational activities and the
diffusion of scientific culture. <br>

The University of Coimbra is a public research university in Coimbra, Portugal. 
First established in Lisbon in 1290, it went through a number of relocations until moving permanently 
to Coimbra in 1537. <br>
The university is among the oldest universities in continuous operation in the world, 
the oldest in Portugal, and played an influential role in the development of higher education in the 
Portuguese-speaking world. <br>
In 2013, UNESCO declared the university a World Heritage Site, noting its architecture, 
unique culture and traditions, and historical role. <br>

The scientific collections of the Museum of the University of Coimbra are unique in Portugal 
and are very important at the international level.
It includes the collection of scientific instruments from the 18<sup>th</sup> and 19<sup>th</sup> 
century of the Physics Museum, the collections of botany, zoology, anthropology and mineralogy 
of the Natural History Museum, and the collections of the Astronomical Observatory and the 
Geophysical Institute of the University of Coimbra. <br>
In 2022, the Post of Portugal issued the set of two stamps 
"<a href="portugal_2022.html">250<sup>th</sup> anniversary Pombal's Reform of the University of Coimbra</a>".  <br>
One of the stamps shows an ammonite of the genus  <em>Echioceras</em> from the 
paleontological collection of the museum, which contains about ten thousand fossils. <br>
