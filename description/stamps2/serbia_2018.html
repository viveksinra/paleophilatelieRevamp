In 1864 Koch started with the investigations of trachites and geology of Fruska Gora Mts.
The topic of his inaugural academic address was the geology of Fruska Gora 
(it became the first geologic monography with the first geologic map of Fruska Gora). 
The main highlights of his scientific work were the review of Transylvanian minerals (1885), 
Tertiary geology of the Transylvanian Basin (1894, 1900), salt analysis, documented of earthquakes and 
analyzed the Transylvanian meteorites, regional geology of Pilis and Visegrád Hills, investigations related

<h2>150<sup>th</sup> anniversary  of Mihailo Petrovic Alas</h2>

Mihailo Petrovic Alas (Belgrade, April 24, 1868 – Belgrade, June 8, 1943) attended the Grande École in 
Belgrade (1885–1889) as well as the prestigious École Normale Supérieure in Paris, being the first foreigner 
educated there. 
He obtained a degree in chemistry as early as in 1891, in mathematics in 1892 and in physics in 1893. 
He obtained his doctorate degree in mathematics in 1894, and became a professor at the Grande École 
(later the University of Belgrade) where he founded Mathematics library in 1895. 
In 1897 he was elected an associate member of the Serbian Royal Academy.

Since the foundation of the University of Belgrade in 1905, he was a full time professor,
being also appointed as Dean of the Faculty of Philosophy twice in the period 1908–1910. 
Having been fascinatingly multi-talented, Petrovic invented the distance meter (1910), the customized auger 
(1913), the calculator of the eternal calendar (1917) and the submarine depth meter (1918). 
He was a member of scientific expeditions to the North Pole in 1931 and in 1933, and also to the
South Pole in 1935.
