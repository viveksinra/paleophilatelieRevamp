On October 10, 2013 Royal
Mail, <a style="font-family: Arial;" href="uk_1991.html">first time since
1991</a>, 
launched a set of ten
self adhesive stamp of "Dinosaurs" (actually four 
animals depicting in these stamps are not dinosaurs,
but flying and marine reptilies: Dimorphodon
 Ornithocheirus, 
 <a href="../../topics/paleo/vertebrate/ichthyosaur.html">Ichthyosaurus</a>, Plesiosaurus ). The new stamp
collection is designed to celebrate the 200 year history of paleontology in Britain
and the discovery of a multitude of dinosaur remains in Britain by
British paleontologists. <br>
<br>
Dinosaurs have often been associated with North America and
the exploration of the Wild West that began in the 1870s, but as mentioned
above the earliest discoveries of dinosaurs and their contemporary marine and flying
reptiles happened in England during the early 1800s. The dinosaurs in
this 10-stamp set have strong connections with the following locations
in Great Britain:<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">LYME
REGIS - DORSET</span><br>
The cliffs and foreshore are the world’s most important and famous sites
for marine reptiles that lived 201-195 million years ago.
<a href="uk_2013.html#Ichthyosaurus">ICHTYOSAURUS</a>
and <a href="uk_2013.html#Plesiosaurus">PLESIOSAURUS</a>
swam in the shallow seas that covered Dorset. The pterosaur <a href="uk_2013.html#Dimorphodon">DIMORPHODON</a>
flew over the water and occasionally
fell in.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">OXFORDSHIRE</span><br>
<a href="uk_2013.html#Megalosaurus">MEGALOSAURUS</a>,
the first dinosaur to be named, came from Stonesfield Quarry near Witney. 
<a href="uk_2013.html#Cetiosaurus">CETIOSAURUS</a> was
discovered in several locations during the 19th century, including
Chipping Norton and Bletchington Station, notable for the most complete
skeleton found.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">OCKLEY
- SURREY</span><br>
The
only fairly complete skeleton of the fish-eating dinosaur, <a href="uk_2013.html#Baryonyx">BARYONYX</a>,
was discovered in a working brick-making clay pit at Wallis Wood, near
Dorking, in 1983. Remains of <a href="uk_2013.html#Iguanodon_">IGUANODON</a>
and a SAUROPOD have also been
uncovered there. <br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">TILGATE
FOREST - WEST SUSSEX </span><br>
The ﬁrst
recognised dinosaur fossils came from a stone quarry at Whiteman’s
Green, Cuckfield. They included teeth discovered in 1822 and
later named<a href="uk_2013.html#Iguanodon_"> IGUANODON</a>.
Pterosaur fragments, originally identified as
birds and later as <a href="uk_2013.html#Ornithocheirus_">ORNITHOCHEIRUS</a>,
were also found there.<br>
<br>
The fossils
from seven of the ten depicting dinosaurs have all previously been found
on the<span style="font-style: italic;"> </span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Isle
of Wight</span>,
many of which are on display at Dinosaur
Isle in
Sandown. Isle of
Wight palaeo-artist <span style="font-family: Arial;">John
Sibbick</span> was
selected from a number of expert artists as he is one of the foremost
illustrators of dinosaurs and has decades of experience. It was felt
that Sibbick’s painterly approach gave a more detailed realisation of
the animals than tests with computer generated imagery at stamp size.
 The stamp designs in this issue are printed such that the
creatures ‘break out’ of the self-adhesive stamp frame, so there is not
a clean straight edge to the stamp.<br>
<span style="font-family: Arial;">Mr.
Sibbick</span>
said: "I always knew that designing and
illustrating stamps was a rigorous and painstaking process.
To get the opportunity was a dream come true, especially depicting the world famous dinosaurs found
on the <span style="font-family: Arial; font-style: italic;">Isle
of Wight</span>. To get such access to fossil dinosaur
bones, tracks and the plants in their environment on the Isle of Wight
makes the reconstruction process a much more vivid experience." The
museum will host an exhibition telling the story
of the creation of <span style="font-family: Arial;">John
Sibbick's work</span>.The stamps have been
produced under the guidance of
palaeontologists from <span style="font-family: Arial;">the
Natural History Museum</span>, including the <span style="font-family: Arial;">Angela
Milner</span>. (who is along with <span style="font-family: Arial;">Alan
Charig</span>, her colleague at the Natural History Museum in London, named and described
Baryonyx, one of the dinosaurs featured in the set. ) Each
illustration is anatomically correct to the extent of present
scientific knowledge.<br>
<br>
The exciting Dinosaur
Island App Trail
based on the ancestral links between the characters in the film and the
<a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinosaurs_of_the_Isle_of_Wight">dinosaurs
on the Isle of Wight</a>,
will give you the chance to be seen standing alongside dinosaurs in the very place they were discovered.
 The app utilises new technology which allows you to
use smart phones and tablets to take pictures of family and friends walking
alongside the dinosaurs that roamed the Isle of Wight 130 million years
ago, while at the same time learning more about their relatives - the
dinosaur characters in the movie. The Augmented Reality App is
available to download from anywhere in the world, but will only
be triggered into life at six
coastal locations on the Isle of Wight.
 <span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
<br>
These
stamps presentation</span>, to public for the first
time, took place at the Natural History Museum in London on
October 7, 2013 - few
days prior to official
release.

Broadcaster and
naturalist, <span style="font-family: Arial;">Sir David
Attenborough</span>
said; “It was a
British scientist, <a href="uk_1991.html">Sir Robert Owen</a>,
the first Director of the Natural
History Museum, who first identified a dinosaur and who invented that
name for the whole group. The sheer size and variety of these extinct
reptiles captivates people of all ages and inspires children’s
imaginations. They are perennially popular and have inspired countless
books, films and television series. These stamps are a wonderful
reminder of the majestic creatures that once roamed what is now Great
Britain hundreds of millions of years ago.”<br>
<br>
Dinosaurs dominated the
Earth for more than 160 million years during
the Mesozoic Era, 252 to 65 million years ago, often called the <a style="font-family: Arial;" href="australia_2013.html">Age
of
Dinosaurs</a>.
They shared the planet with many other animals
including
marine reptiles, <a href="../../topics/paleo/vertebrate/ichthyosaur.html">ichthyosaurs</a> and plesiosaurs, and flying reptiles
called pterosaurs. The first finds of all these ancient groups were
made in southern England in the early 1800s. Thus began our
ever-growing fascination with this long-lost world.<br>

The
Ichthyosaurus, the Plesiosaurus and the Dimorphodon were all first
discovered by Mary
Anning (famous British fossil collector, dealer, and
paleontologist) on the beaches of Lyme Regis at the beginning
of the 19th century, and their fossilised remains can still be found
along the Jurassic Coast today.<br>
Mary Anning and her brother
Joseph discovered the first ever Ichthyosaurus in 1811 on the beaches
between Lyme Regis and Charmouth. Mary continued to find fossilised
remains of the Ichthyosaurus during the next ten years, before
discovering the Plesiosaurus in the winter of 1828. <br>
David
Tucker, curator at Lyme Regis museum, said he was delighted the Royal
Mail had commemorated Anning’s finds in the stamp collection, he
said “The collection is very interesting and shows the very
strong local connection in marine reptile fossil discovery and I’m
delighted they have chosen three of Anning’s discoveries. I will
certainly be getting some of the stamps, and I am very pleased to see
them.”

The stamp set was
originally
scheduled for release last year (2012), to mark the centenary of the
publication of ”The Lost World”, a novel by Sir Arthur Conan
Doyle
that tells the story of an exhibition to South America led by
Professor Challenger that discovers a whole host of prehistoric animals
surviving on a remote plateau. Ironically, a number of
animals
featured on the stamps such as the Iguanodon along with the Pterosaur
Dimorphodon and the marine reptiles are featured in this book. The
South American Spinosaurid Irritator, a dinosaur from the same branch
of the Theropoda family tree as Baryonyx has a link to Sir Arthur Conan
Doyle’s novel. The specific name for Irritator (Irritator
challengeri)
is a reference to Professor Challenger, the
central character in the book. Finaly the stamps launched end
of 2013, only two months prior to UK Premiere of WALKING
WITH DINOSAURS: THE 3D MOVIE<br>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal" align="left">The lightweight ornithocheirus (‘bird hand’)
flew by soaring and gliding on its long, narrow wings, and fed by
skimming the surface of the sea to catch fish in slender jaws which
were fringed with outwardly-pointing, interlocking teeth.</p>
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" class="MsoNormal" align="left">Ornithocheirus represents the pterodactyloid
pterosaurs. This species was first described by Harry Govier Seeley in
1869, though the fossils had been known of since 1827.</p>

rhamphorhynchoid pterosaurs and was described by William Clift and
William John Broderip in 1835. This description was based on
a fossil that was discovered by Mary Anning in 1828.</p>

The long shins of the Hypsilophodon suggest that a speedy escape was
its main means of defence. With a short thigh and a long shin,
hypsilophodon (‘high-ridge tooth’)
was a fast runner. With no body armour, running would have been this
comparatively small plant-eating biped’s
only defence from predators.</td>
