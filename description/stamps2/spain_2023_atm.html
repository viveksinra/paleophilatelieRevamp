Between April 19<sup>th</sup> and April 23<sup>rd</sup>, Teruel  
(the capital of Teruel Province in Aragon, located in eastern Spain) 
hosted 3 philatelic events at the same time: 
<ul style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;">
	<li>the 61<sup>st</sup> National Philatelic Exhibition and Spanish Championship - EXFILNA 2023</li>
	<li>the 28<sup>th</sup> National Exhibition of Youth Philately and Spanish Championship - JUVENIA 2023</li>
	<li>the 5<sup>th</sup> European Championship of Maximofilia</li>
</ul>
For more details about these shows, please click <a href="spain_2023_dino.html#shows">here</a>. <br>
<br>

In order to commemorate these events, "Correos" - Post Company of Spain, issued a 
<a href="spain_2023_dino.html">gummed stamp depicting the dinosaur 
"<em>Aragosaurus ischiaticus</em>"</a>, 
3 ATM-labels and 20 postmarks, including 5 First-Day-of-Issue postmarks 
for ATM stamps, as well as some philatelic souvenirs. 
These ATM stamps were on sale in Teruel and Albarracin (37km away from Teruel) 
during the show's hours, as well as at the philatelic desk in Madrid. <br>

One of the ATM-labels featured a skull of a prehistoric marine reptile - <em>Liopleurodon</em>, 
who lived during the Late Jurassic - 166 to 155 million years ago. <br>

<p>
	ATM-labels are semi-ready stamps. <br>
		Part or an entire design is pre-printed, 
		the skull of <em>Liopleurodon</em> and the text in blue color on the 
		right side of the stamp for example. <br>
		The face value and in some cases additional text or images are printed on the 
		label by the vending machine at the time of purchase. 
		The stamp vending machine is called an Automatic Teller Machine or ATM.  <br>
		<br>
		ATM vending machines can be installed inside or outside of the post offices and 
		print stamps on the ATM-labels. 
		These Spanish machines print text and simple images, such as the silhouette of 
		<em>Liopleurodon</em>, by thermic procedures on thermal self-adhesive labels. <br>
		The ATM-labels, usually loaded in the vending machines in rolls of several 
		hundreds or thousands of labels (1.500 labels in the Spanish machines). 
</p>

In Teruel there are no (permanent) ATM machines or kiosks. 
For the exhibition only, "Correos" installed the kiosk and the computer system in its 
stand at the large tent temporarily placed in the Glorieta square.
The computer system included five Brother printers able to print the three different 
ATM designs and its corresponding receipts. 
At the kiosk, which can only print ATM stamps from two reels, the three designs were 
alternated during the entire show.
In addition, "Correos" installed the one-day stands at Albarracín and Mora de Rubielos 
(printing the castle design). 
At these temporary stands they installed only one computer system with two Brother 
printers (one for the ATM stamps and another for the receipts). <br>


<br>
The ATM-label of the <em>Liopleurodon</em> stamp, 
contain the following pre-printed Spanish text underneath: 
"REPTIL MARINO LIOPLEURODON MAR NUMMUS (ALBARRACIN)" 
- in English: Marine Reptile <em>Liopleurodon</em> Mar Nummus (Albarracin). <br>
The face value, date, place of the issue, additional image of <em>Liopleurodon</em>'s 
silhouette and the stamp ID code, where printed by the vending machine on the left 
side of the stamp. <br>

<br>
Every stamp has a unique code on the bottom-left side. 
The code is built from two parts.
For example: P4ES23 AL23-5119-001 <br>
	<table align="right" width="300px"   style="margin-left: 10px; margin-top: 10px" >

				title="Liopleurodon on ATM stamp of Spain 2023"></td>
		</tr>
	</table>

The first part contains the machine/printer code, the month number, the country code, 
and a two-digit year. 
In the example above (<em>P4ES23</em>), the P refers to the Brother printer, 4 refers to April, 
ES refers to the international code for Spain (referring to the country's Spanish name 
Reino de España), while the 23 refers to the current year, 2023. <br>
The second part contain "machine/printer ID" - 
"purchase number" (digits that increase with every purchase) - 
"number of stamp in the purchase". 
<!--
	For this reason the number of labels / stamps of each session is limited to 875. 
	Anyway, it is impossible to print 875 stamp in one session, as the total amount 
	would be bigger than 399€.
-->

<em>AL23-5119-001</em>, on the example above, means:
"AL23" - the printer installed in Albarracin town, 
"5119" - the purchase/order, 
"001"  - stamp number in the purchase. <br>

<p>
	The stamps purchased by an individual at the ATM are numbered starting from 001. <br> 
    The following stamp combinations can be printed by the vending machine: <br>
	(1) single stamps with the four available postal tariffs,              <br>
	(2) collectors strips of four stamps for domestic mail,                <br>
	(3) collectors strips with the four-values set.                        <br>
	<br>
	In one purchase operation one or a combination of 3 options can be ordered.
	For example: 10 ATM domestic stamps, 
	plus three strips of four domestic stamps, plus five sets of four values. <br>
	Only these two last options include the printing of single receipts per item. 
	Then, the system prints one receipt as a summary or list of the complete operation 
	with the total, plus three receipts for the three strips of domestic stamps, 
	plus five additional receipts for the sets. 
	This allows the collector to have one single receipt per each collectors strip bought. <br>
	Therefore, stamp numbers on the invoices on the right, start not on 001, but 
	on 057, 005, 133 accordingly.
</p>

<br>
These ATM stamps were printed by printers/machines of two companies: 
"P" - Brother and "B" - Intelligent AR Limited, at four locations:

		<br>
		Correos company has only one postal kiosk (manufactured by intelligent AR in the UK).
		The Postal kiosk is permanently installed at Madrid's post office, near the Correos Clara 
		Campoamor building. <br>
		Several times per year, for the main philatelic events, the staff moves the kiosk for 
		just a few days to the events. 
		From 19 to 23rd April, the kiosk was moved to EXFILNA in Teruel for example. <br>
		The rest of the year, it is possible to order ATM stamps of the different
		designs released over the year (with a minimum order amount).
		These ATM stamps printed the actual month number, but without 
		additional graphics (without <em>Liopleurodon</em>'s silhouette, for example).		
	</li>
</ul>
<!--
   In Spain we have two types of equipment producing ATMs, 
   (1) the postal kiosk (all the stamps with ES01 code) and 
   (2) a computer system arranged by the philatelic service, 
   including several Brother printers (to be used depending on the situation). 
   The stamps printed by this computer system in its permanent location, 
   in Madrid, have this year the code MDCC. 
   
   When this computer system, with one, two or up to five or six printers, travel to 
   a stamp event, then the stamps printed have a special code. 
   In Teruel, the computer system was made up of five printers, two printing the 
   two EXFILNA ATM stamps (with code EX23), one for the receipts corresponding to these stamps, 
   another printer for the JUVENIA Liopleurodon stamp (with code JU23) and the fifht one 
   for the receipts printing of the JU23 stamps. 
   The computer system moved to Albarracin had two printers only, one for the 
   stamps (with special code AL23) and another for the receipts.
-->

These ATM stamps were printed in four values: A, A2, B, C. <br>
<ul style="margin-top: 10px;">
	<li>Rate A  - 0,78€. - "standardized" Ordinary National Letter or Postcard, up to 20 g.</li>
	<li>Rate A2 - 0,88€ - Letter or Ordinary National Postcard "standardized", from 20 to 50 g.</li>
	<li>Rate B - 1,65€ - "standardized" Ordinary International Letter or Postcard addressed to Europe 
		(including Greenland), up to 20 g.</li>
	<li>Rate C - 1,75€ -  "standardized" Ordinary International Letter or Postcard addressed 
		to the rest of the world (except USA, Canada, Japan, Australia and New Zealand), up to 20 g.</li>
</ul>


<br>
The skull on the stamp shows the skull from the Mar Nummus Museum. 
This museum is the headquarters of Territorio Dinópolis, located in Albarracín town 
(37km away from Teruel). 

<p>
	The satellite <strong>Dinopolis in Albarracín</strong> was inaugurated on 1 July 2008 and it is part 
	of a Teruel-organised tour entitled Dinopolis-Jurassic Route, which addresses the 
	extraordinary diversity of Jurassic invertebrate marine fossils found in these areas. <br>
	Formed by a large central park in Teruel and seven more centers in eight locations in its province, 
	Dinópolis combines science and fun, so that visitor can live closely the fascinating world of dinosaurs. 
	A journey of 4,500 million years in which visitors hear the first heartbeat of the Earth, 
	discover how life arose and with it the most extraordinary creatures that have ever existed.

<strong>The Mar Nummus Museum</strong> in Albarracín is dedicated to the living beings that lived in the sea that was in this area more than 
150 million years ago.<br>
At that time, the Sierra de Albarracín was covered by the Tethys Sea. <br>
Jurassic marine fossils such as ammonites and sponges are on display at the Mar Nummus Museum. <br>
Many of these fossils were discovered in the calcareous rocks that border 
the Guadalaviar River and the roads that accompany it. 
The fossils of marine reptiles are quite limited in Teruel, however.  
A Pliosaurid vertebra was found at Jabaloyas village (the village where Mar Nummus is 
located), is on the display in the museum. <br>

<a name="liopleurodon"></a>
The skull of the <em>Liopleurodon</em> on display in the Mar Nummus Museum is a replica of a skull of 
<strong><em>Liopleurodon rossicus</em></strong> (recent papers referred it as <strong><em>Pliosaurus rossicus</em></strong>), 
to illustrate to the general public the presence of this group of marine reptiles in the area. <br>

<br>
Pliosaurs (meaning 'more lizard'), a group of large carnivorous marine reptiles 
characterized by massive heads, short necks, and streamlined tear-shaped bodies. 
Pliosaurs have been found as fossils from the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods 
(about 200 million to 65.5 million years ago). <br>
They are classified in the order Plesiosauria, along with their long-necked relatives, 
the plesiosaurs. 
Pliosaurs possessed powerful jaws and large teeth, and they used four large fins to 
swim through Mesozoic seas.
Their diet would have included fish, cephalopods, and marine reptiles, including 
<a href="../../topics/paleo/vertebrate/ichthyosaur.html">ichthyosaurs</a>.

Most species of <em>Pliosaurus</em> reached 8 metres in length and 5 tons in body mass, 
while <em>Pliosaurus rossicus</em> and <em>Pliosaurus funkei</em> may have reached 
or even exceeded 10 metres in length and 11 tons in body mass, being the largest 
plesiosaurs of all time. <br>

Four strong paddle-like limbs suggest that <em>Pliosaurus</em> was a powerful swimmer. 
The hind flippers are longer than the fore flippers - a very unusual feature, as it is 
the opposite case for most of the plesiosaurs. 
The feature might enhance their ability to accelerate, desirable trait in an ambush 
predator. <br>
<br>

<a name="skull"></a>
According to the label under the skull at the Mar Nummus Museum, this skull is a 
replica of a <em>Liopleurodon rossicus</em> skull from the Buinsk Mine Oil Shales, 
Chuvashia (Russia) that is Jurassic in age. <br>
(Original text: "Replica de craneo de <em>Liopleurodon rossicus</em>, Jurasico Superior, 
Buinsk Mine Oil Shales, Chuvashia (Russia)") <br>

The full-size replica of the reptile, was mounted on the roof of the museum 
(see a video below). <br>
The <a href="#pm_albarracín">postmark of Albarracin</a> reproduce the replica. <br>
<br>

<!-- Pliosaurus rossicus -->
The first fossil of <em>Pliosaur/Liopleurodon rossicus</em> was found in the 
Buinsk shale mine, in Chuvashia region of Russia in 1937. <br>
It was described and named by Soviet paleontologist Nestor Ivanovich Novozhilov in 1948.  <br>
The specific name is derived from the name of Russia, where the holotype was found. 
The holotype of <em>Pliosaurus rossicus</em>, PIN 304/1 is housed at the Paleontological 
Institute, Russian Academy of Sciences in Moscow and consists of cranial and some 
postcranial remains of a relatively small pliosaur.  <br>
The fossils belonged to a very young pliosaurus who did not exceed 5m in length.  <br>

	<p>
		The skull, and reconstruction of the pliosaur were displayed on a 
		<a href="russia_2020.html#pliosaurus">postage stamp of Russia in 2020</a>.	
	</p>

The skull from the display in Mar Nummus Museum in Albarracín, looks different, as
the skull from Buinsk Mine Oil Shales have closed jaws. 
Albarracín's skull resemble another <em>Pliosaurus rossicus</em>'s skull, discovered 
in Russia - the best known fossil of <em>Pliosaurus rossicus</em> known to date, 
unearthed by fossil hunters near Ulyanovsk city of Russia in mid-1990<sup>th</sup> 
and illegally moved to Japan, where it was perfectly prepared and mounted in 
"Iwaki City Coal and Fossil Museum Horuru". <br>

<!-- 
<strong><em>Liopleurodon</em></strong>, meaning "smooth-sided teeth", a reference to the circular cross-section of its teeth.
It was an extinct genus of large, carnivorous marine reptile belonging to the Thalassophonea, a clade of 
short-necked pliosaurid plesiosaurs. <br>
They lived in the Late Jurassic Period, between 166 and 155 million years ago and 
shared the sea with <a href="../../topics/paleo/vertebrate/ichthyosaur.html">ichthyosaurus</a>
and plesiosaurs, who did they hunt. <br>

The largest species, <em>Liopleurodon ferox</em>, is estimated to have grown up to 6.6 metres in length 
based on the largest known skull. <br>
Studies of the skull have shown that it could probably scan the water with 
its nostrils to ascertain the source of certain smells. <br>

<em>Liopleurodon</em> was named in 1873, by Henri Émile Sauvage, based on single tooth 
discovered in France.
Fossils of the animal have been found mainly in England and France, but also in Germany 
and <a href="russia_2020.html#pliosaurus">Russia</a>. <br>
