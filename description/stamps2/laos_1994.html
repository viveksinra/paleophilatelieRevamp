	On December 8<sup>th</sup>, 1994, the Post of Laos issued their third set of stamps dedicated to Prehistoric Animals. <br>
    These colorful, but very abstract, reconstructions of these dinosaurs were chosen for this set of stamps at this time.  
	Unlike the previous two sets, this time the stamps show dinosaurs found in Mesozoic rock units of Laos.

The first fossils of dinosaurs were discovered in Laos in 1936 by a French
geologist, <strong>Josué-Heilman HOFFET</strong> (1901-1945),  pioneer of Geology and Paleontology of Laos.
<br>
During geological mapping of terrestrial formations of Bas-Laos, near the village of Tang Vay 
(120 km east of Savannaketh), he accidentally discovered various dinosaur fossils,
as well as the remains of turtles and crocodiles.<br>
Based on these fragmental remains that included a large femur and a small
caudal vertebra, HOFFET described two new dinosaur species 
<em>Titanosaurus falloti</em> (the specimens name honors Paul Fallot, HOFFET's mentor at the University of Nancy) in 1942 and
<em>Manchurosaurus laoensis</em> (<em>Hadrosaur</em> or commonly referred to as Duck-billed dinosaurs) in 1943.
<br>
In 1940, while the Japanese occupied Laos, HOFFET was mobilized and joined the intelligence services in Hue in Vietnam.
He disappeared in 1945 during the fighting at the Nui Tho Pass near Hanoi, and was then declared as “dead for France” in 1947.
<br>

<br>
In 1990 paleontologist Philippe Taquet, then director of the National Museum of Natural History in Paris, 
took over the work of <span lang="fr">Josué-Heilman HOFFET</span>. 
He organized several expeditions to the country and found several dinosaur deposits from the Lower Cretaceous, 
Aptian-Albian Age (126-100 million years ago), notably at Ban Tang Vay, Ban Nakhapong, 
and at Ban Viengh Hay. 
Paleontologists suggests that the fossil-bearing red beds of Laos are equivalent to the Khok Kruat Formation 
of the Khorat Group in <a href="../../country/thailand.html">Thailand</a>. <br>
These discoveries show a great resemblance between the dinosaurs of Laos and those of China, 
thus confirming the links between the Indochinese peninsula and the rest of Asia during the Cretaceous period.<br>

<br>
Fossils of four different dinosaurs were found by the expedition:<br> 
<ul style="margin-top: 0">
	<li>a <em>Psittacosaurus</em>, a small dinosaur with a parrot's beak</li>
	<li>a medium-sized <em>Iguanodon</em></li>
	<li>a large <em>Sauropod</em> (a complete hind leg and 30 vertebrae of the tail of the same individual)</li>
	<li>a quadrupedal herbivorous dinosaur, who was named after Josué-Heilman HOFFET <em>Tangvayosaurus hoffeti</em></li>
</ul>

As these dinosaurs were not yet well described in 1994, when the stamps were issued, similar dinosaurs 
from the same taxa were depicted on the stamps.
The sauropod stamp has an illustration of <em>Saltasaurus</em> which is likely similar to 
<em>Tangvayosaurus</em> – a well-known Laotian dinosaur at the time the stamps were issued. <br>

<br>	
<big><strong><em>Tangvayosaurus</em></strong></big> (meaning "Tang Vay lizard") is a genus of sauropod dinosaur from 
the Aptian-Albian Age Early Cretaceous from the <span lang="fr">Grès supérieurs</span> Formation of Savannakhet, Laos.
<br> 
It was a primitive or basal herbivorous dinosaur that is classified as part of the Titanosaurs. 
The Titanosaurs were a group that included some of the largest dinosaurs who ever roamed the Earth.  
<em>Tangvayosaurus</em> was about 15 meters long and weighed 15 tons in life. 
Unfortunately, this species is only known from the fragmented remains of 2 or 3 individuals.<br>
<br>
As it is described from singles bones only, the exact placement of <em>Tangvayosaurus</em> is debated.
The most recent classification tentatively retains this genus, because it is sufficiently different 
from a sauropod from next door in Thailand, <em>Phuwiangosaurus</em>. 
<em>Phuwiangosaurus</em> was depicted on a <a href="thailand_1997.html">1997 stamp from Thailand</a>. <br>

	<big><strong><em>Iguanodon</em></strong>-like dinosaur</big><br>
	A few bones of an <em>Iguanodon</em>-like dinosaur have also been discovered in Laos prior to this issue 
	being published. 
	Even today, these bones are still too incomplete and fragmented to assign this dinosaur to a 
	specific species.<br>

	As one of the first scientifically well-known dinosaurs, <em>Iguanodon</em> has occupied a notable place in the 
	public's perception of dinosaurs, its artistic representation changing significantly in response to new 
	interpretations of its remains. <br>
    <br>
	<em>Iguanodon</em>, right after it was described in 1825, was portrayed as a quadrupedal horn-nosed beast. <br>
    Since 1882, after the largest find of <em>Iguanodon</em> remains in a coal mine at Bernissart in Belgium, 
	<em>Iguanodon</em> was portrayed as a bipedal dinosaur standing by a tree and eating.<br> 
	<br>
	During his re-examination of Iguanodon, in 1980, Dr. David Norman, who also wrote 
	"The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Dinosaurs" book, that inspired the stamp designer, 
	was able to show that this posture was unlikely, because the long tail was stiffened with ossified tendons. 
	Since then, it is accepted to portrayed <em>Iguanodon</em> as quadrupedal dinosaur.
	However, long after 1980 <em>Iguanodon</em> was still depicted in many books and postage stamps,
	in old style, staying or walking on two legs.

	The very well preserved remains of a theropod dinosaur consisting of a partial skeleton without skull 
	or limbs was found in Laos between 2010 and 2014. <br>
	
    <br>
	<big><strong><em>Ichthyovenator</em></strong></big> (meaning "Fish Hunter") is a genus of spinosaurid dinosaur from
	the Aptian-Albian Age Early Cretaceous (125 and 113 million years ago), from Gres superieurs Formation of Savannakhet, Laos.
	<br>
	This specimen became the holotype of the new genus and species <em>Ichthyovenator laosensis</em>, and was described by palaeontologist 
	Ronan Allain and colleagues in 2012. 
	The species’ name refers to the provenance from Laos. <br>
	The estimated size of the dinosaur is 8.5 - 10.5 meters long and weighing 2.5 tons.

	Like other dinosaurs of the <em>Spinosaurid</em> family, <em>Ichthyovenator</em> had tall neural spines that formed a sail on its back. 
	The unique feature of <em>Ichthyovenator</em> is sinusoidal (wave-like) sail shape that curved downwards 
	and 	divided into <em>two separate sails</em>.
