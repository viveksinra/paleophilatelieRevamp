<a name="intro"></a>
On April 13 2015, Post of Canada issued a set of 5 self-adhesive
Dinosaur stamps, the first time since <a href="canada_1993.html">1993</a>.<br>
<p>
	Even though the set name is "Dinosaurs of Canada", not all the prehistoric animals
	featured on this year’s stamps are actually dinosaurs, one of the animals is mosasaur -
	the marine reptile, when dinosaurs are terrestrial reptiles per definition. 	
</p>

These stamps were issued in a Mini-Sheet of 5 and a Booklet of 10. <br>

With a 3-D-like design that breaks through the boundaries of a
typical stamp (similar to <a href="uk_2013.html">UK stamps 2013</a>), 
Canada Post brings to life five prehistoric animals that once roamed Canada: <br>
<br>

<a href="#chasmosaurus"><em>Chasmosaurus belli</em></a>        <br>
<a href="#chasmosaurus"><em>Euoplocephalus tutus</em></a>      <br>
<a href="#chasmosaurus"><em>Ornithomimus edmontonicus</em></a> <br>
<a href="#chasmosaurus"><em>Tylosaurus pembinensis</em></a> 
    (not dinosaur, but mosasaur - marine reptile)              <br>
<a href="#chasmosaurus"><em>Tyrannosaurus rex</em></a>         <br>

<br>
The animals pulse with life, charged by the multilevel embossing and holographic foiling used in 
most of the designs. 
They tear their way through barren background images of Dinosaur Provincial Park, 
one of Canada’s richest sources of dinosaur fossils. <br>

<br>
The stamps were presented by Canada Post April 9 at Toronto’s
<a href="canada_2014.html">Royal Ontario Museum</a>, the colorful quintet of 
“thunder-lizards” range from agile, birdlike <em>Ornithomimus edmontonicus</em> to meat-seeking
superstar <em>Tyrannosaurus rex</em>, whose modest crown of feathers fails to
distract from the slavering jaws and massive, dagger-like teeth of
perhaps the greatest predator that ever lived. <br>

	"Canada’s rich geography and spectacular landscape define this country and who we are.
	We have a special fascination for the creatures that walked this land in the ancient past. 
	With these stamps, we rediscover the magic they hold for us."
</em>
	says the Honourable Lisa Raitt, Minister of Transport, responsible for Canada Post. <br>
<br>	
<em>"Canadians young and old marvel at these wonders of nature and will be intrigued to discover 
	 in this stamp issue fascinating clues to the lives these dinosaurs lived.
	 Our stamp program tells Canada’s story. 
	 This is a story like no other."
</em>

The team that designed these stamps was made up of four people: 
<ul>
	<li>
		paleo-artist Julius Csotonyi from Vancouver drew the dinosaurs and mosasaur at their environment
	</li>
	<li>
		photographer Judy Arndt took photos of landscapes of Dinosaur Provincial Park in Alberta, 
        Canada at a place where many dinosaur fossils are found
	</li>
	<li>
		designer Andrew Perro, who has designed several Canadian stamps, compiled images 
		of Julius Csotonyi and photos of Judy Arndt together
	</li>
	<li>
		paleontologist Dr. Jordan Mallon of the Canadian Museum of Nature 
		provided some scientific background to the paleoartist in order to ensure  images of the prehistoric 
		animals are representative of the most recent scientific view.
	</li>
</ul>

<em>
	"It was important to strike an effective balance in pose and colour patterns that were gripping and 
	imposing yet scientifically accurate or plausible."
</em> says Csotonyi, an award-winning natural history illustrator and biological sciences graduate. <br>
<em>
	"I was pretty excited about an opportunity like this… it’s kind of neat to spread information about 
	Canadian dinosaurs."
</em> Csotonyi said.  <br>
<em>
	"The stranger something is the neater it is."
</em> 
He hopes the drawings encourage people to learn more about dinosaurs.  <br>
<em>
	"Any kind of means or media in which we can interest people about science and the funky discoveries 
	about dinosaurs is to me pretty exciting." 
</em> he said.<br>

	I have collaborated on projects with several major museums, paleontologists and book publishers from 
	around the globe, including the National Geographic Society and the Royal Tyrrell Museum, working closely 
	with scientists and drawing on my own scientific background. <br>
	Recently, I have also illustrated a number of coins for the Royal Canadian Mint. 
	An MSc graduate of Ecology and Environmental Biology (University of Alberta), and a PhD graduate in

	mutualisms, and unusual bacteria from deep ocean hydrothermal volcanic vents. <br>
	My scientific background impels me to strive to restore as realistically as possible the broad diversity
	of environments that earth has hosted in its deep past. 
	My style ranges from pencil, ink, watercolour and pastel to 2-dimensional digital illustrations 
	(which form the bulk of my work) and 3-dimensional digital models. <br>
	My work encompasses dinosaurs and other prehistoric life, sharks and other living animals, paleobotany,

<br>
<em>
	"My duties were two fold: to help decide which prehistoric animals would be featured on the stamps, 
	and to vet the artwork and related text for accuracy.  <br>
	I initially came up with a list of 24 dinosaurs and other prehistoric organisms as possible contenders 
	for the stamps.  <br>
	These contenders ranged from all parts of Canada, all branches of the Tree of Life, and all periods of 
	the geologic timescale.  <br>
	Narrowing down the contestants to just five species was difficult, and there were many worthy animals
	that did not make the cut. <br>
	For each of the finalists, I benefited from having direct access to superb fossil remains from each one, 
	all held in our museum’s national fossil collection.  <br>

<em>
	The Canadian Museum of Nature, in fact, has the type specimens for <em>Ornithomimus edmontonicus</em>, 
	<em>Chasmosaurus belli</em>, and <em>Euoplocephalus tutus</em>.  <br>
	These are the first of their kind used to describe the species, and have immense scientific and 
	historical value. <br>

	We wanted to be able to say something interesting about each of the featured species, and to draw a 
	connection to Canada—to the places where they were found and to the people they honour. <br>
	For example, the ostrich-mimic <em>Ornithomimus edmontonicus</em> is named after a rock unit called the 
	Edmonton Formation where it was found, which itself is named after the city of Edmonton. <br>
	The name of the horned dinosaur <em>Chasmosaurus belli</em> likewise honours Robert Bell, a former 
	natural sciences professor at Queen’s University, and administrative head of the Geological Survey of 
	Canada. <br>
	There are many scientific subtleties on the stamps that I hope won’t go undetected. 
	Did you notice that the <em>Ornithomimus</em> has wings? Or that the <em>Tylosaurus</em> has a tail fluke? 
	Or that the nostril of the <em>Chasmosaurus</em> is positioned forward on its face, as opposed to back 
	towards its nasal horn?  <br>
	These are all scientific findings that have only come to light in recent years." <br>

<a name="euoplocephalus"></a>
<strong><em>Euoplocephalus tutus</em></strong>, 
an herb-eater that was known for its spiky, plated armour. 
Its complex and unusual series of nasal passages may have warmed inhaled air, improved the animal’s 
sense of smell or helped it vocalize.<br>

<br>
<em>Euoplocephalus tutus</em> (meaning "well-armored head") lived between 85 and 65 million years ago, 
in the late Cretaceous period in Canada. 
Canadian palaeontologist Lawrence Lambe first described this ankylosaurid dinosaur in 1902, giving it the 
name <em>Stereocephalus</em>, but that name had already been given to an insect, so it was changed in 1910. 
<em>Euoplocephalus</em> was a plant eating (herbivorous) dinosaur.  <br> 
It had a complicated nasal structure, which indicates that it probably had a good sense of smell. 
It had flexible legs, which it might have used for digging. 
The stiff, low-slung dinosaur had poor teeth (weak dentition), so it probably would have grazed on 
fleshy low-lying vegetation and shallow tubers.  <br>
Among the ankylosaurids, <em>Euoplocephalus</em> was exceeded in size only by <em>Tarchia</em> 
and <em>Ankylosaurus</em>.  <br>
<em>Euoplocephalus</em> was 6 meters long and weighed over 2 tons, about the size of an elephant. 
While it was about 2.5 meters wide, it was low-slung, with short, stout legs. 
The rear legs were larger than the front legs and all four limbs were tipped with hoof-like claws. 
Like all ankylosaurids, it had a flat, thick, triangular skull. <br>

The mouth included a horny beak and the teeth were small and roughly leaf-shaped.
It had a short neck. 
A skeleton of the extinct, heavily armored dinosaur <em>Euoplocephalus tutus</em>, an herbivore, 
showing its long row of spikes and its clubbed tail. <br>
The entire head and body of the <em>Euoplocephalus</em> are covered with bands of armor, which allowed a
surprising amount of flexibility. 
It was the first ankylosaurid discovered with armored shutters that it could slide down to cover its
eyelids! <br>
Each piece of armor was composed of a thick oval plate, embedded in the thick surrounding skin, which was 
studded with short, horny spikes (dermal scutes, like those of crocodiles), which were about 
10 to 15 centimeters long. <br>
In addition to the spines running down its back, <em>Euoplocephalus</em> had large horns growing
from the back of its head. 
It also had a bony club at the end of its rigid tail, which it carried above the ground. 
The tail was muscular, so the club could be swung from side to side for defense.  <br>
Internally, many bones were fused together to provide support for the heavy armor. 
The backbone (the dorsal vertebrae) merged with the ribs, and several of the backbones in front of 
the hips (presacral vertebrae) were also fused together into a rod. 
The tail is made from hardened tissues, which are fused to the tail bones. <br>

<strong><em>Chasmosaurus belli</em></strong>,  
a relative of the famous <em>Triceratops</em>.
Its large frill was supported by a bony framework that was likely used for display, not defence. <br>
A baby <em>Chasmosaurus</em> was recently found in Dinosaur Provincial Park. 
It was less than three years old when it died. <br>
<br>
In 2010, paleontologist Philip Currie came across a very unusual fossil in the barren badlands of 
Dinosaur Provincial Park in Alberta, Canada: a baby <em>Chasmosaurus belli</em>, a ceratopsian dinosaur 
from the Late Cretaceous. <br>
Only the edge of the frill on back of the skull was visible when Currie first came upon it, but eventually 
he dug out a nearly complete, articulated specimen. <br>
The only bones missing were the dinosaur's front legs. 
Currie is professor of Dinosaur Paleobiology at the University of Alberta, in Edmonton, after three long 
years of lab preparation, he and his staff are proudly 
showed off their prize dinosaur after it was ready to be displayed. <br>

<strong><em>Tyrannosaurus rex</em></strong>,  the “tyrant king” of dinosaurs. <br>
High school teacher Robert Gebhardt discovered one of the largest and most complete skeletons of its 
kind in Saskatchewan in 1991. 
The skeleton has been nicknamed “Scotty.” <br>
<br>
On August 16, 1991, then high school teacher, Robert Gebhardt from Eastend joined RSM palaeontologists on 
a prospecting expedition to the exposed bedrock along the Frenchman River Valley to learn how fossils
are found and identified in the field. <br> 
Within a half a day, he discovered the base of a heavily worn tooth, and a vertebra from the tail, 
both suggesting that they belonged to a <em>T. rex</em>. 
In June 1994, RSM palaeontologists began excavating the <em>Tyrannosaurus</em>, one of the largest known 
carnivorous dinosaurs. <br>
Over 6,000 people visited Scotty's excavation site during 1994.<br>
<br>
The 65 million year old skeleton was the first <em>T. rex</em> skeleton found in Saskatchewan and one of 
only 12 known in the world at the time. 
As the individual bones were removed from the rock in the RSM lab, Scotty provided new information both
about <em>T. rex</em> and about prehistoric Saskatchewan. <br>

<strong><em>Ornithomimus edmontonicus</em></strong>,
now known to have sported long arm feathers. <br>
It used its speed to outrun predators and to hunt for prey, which included small lizards and mammals.<br>
<br>
<em>Ornithomimus</em> ("bird mimic") is a genus of ornithomimid dinosaur from the Late Cretaceous Period 
(70-65 mya) of what is now North America. <br>
In 1890 <em>Ornithomimus velox</em> was named by Othniel Charles Marsh on the basis of a foot and partial 
hand from the Maastrichtian Denver Formation. <br>
Another seventeen species have been named since. 
Most of these have subsequently been assigned to new genera or shown to be not directly related to 
<em>Ornithomimus</em>. 

The best material for this genus is still the material found in Canada representing the earlier 
Edmontonian-aged <em>Ornithomimus edmontonicus</em> Sternberg 1933, which is known from 
several skeletons. <br>


Its exact size is relatively unknown, with the average estimates hovering around 4 to 4.8 meters
long, depending on which individuals are considered to be valid species of the genus. <br>
It differs from other members of its family in having a shorter torso, longer and slender forearms, very 
slender hands, and straight hand and foot claws. 
It has been found with evidence of feathers, including pennaceous feathers on the lower arm, and
filamentous feathers on the body of a juvenile, indicating that the more advanced feathers were features 
of adults only. <br>
In 1995, 2008 and 2009, three <em>Ornithomimus edmontonicus</em> specimens, two adults and a juvenile, 
were found with remains of pennaceous feather shafts on the lower arm or with impressions of up to five 
centimetres long primitive feathers in the form of hair-like filaments covering the rump, legs and neck. <br>
The fact that the feather imprints were found in sandstone, previously thought to not be able to support 
such impressions, gives new possibilities for future feather finds. <br>
A study describing these fossils in 2012 concluded that <em>Ornithomimus edmontonicus</em> was 
covered in plumaceous feathers at all growth stages, and that only adults had pennaceous wing-like 
structures, suggesting that wings may have evolved for mating displays. <br>

<br>
Bruce lived during the late Cretaceous period, approximately 80 million years ago. 
He swam in a deep sea environment with numerous other marine reptiles. 
This ocean is termed the Western Interior Seaway and split North America in two. 
The Seaway spanned from the frigid waters of the Arctic Ocean to the warm currents of the Gulf of Mexico. <br>
Bruce belonged to a group of Mosasaurs called the <em>Tylosaurs</em>. 
These <em>Tylosaurs</em> were the largest of the Mosasaurs, Bruce being the largest in Canada for this 
time period, approximately 13 meters long from snout to tail. 
Bruce was a fierce predator, top of the food chain in the Seaway eating anything it its path from 
plesiosaurs to ammonites (shelled organisms). <br>
Palaeontologists think the Mosasaurs lineage branched off from a lizard group known 
today as the Monitor Lizards. <br>
In 1974 Bruce was discovered north of Thornhill within the Pembina Member of the Pierre Shale Formation. 
It took approximately two field seasons to excavate the skeleton. <br>
The skeleton was reasonably complete with 65-70% of the original bones. <br>

<br>
On March 15 2015, the CFDC proudly unveiled the newest member to join the nation’s largest collection of 
marine reptile fossils. <br>
‘Suzy’ is the more than 9 meter long skeleton of a mosasaur joining ‘Bruce’, in what was formerly known
as the Bruce Gallery – now called Mosasaur Hall. <br>
<em>
	“The addition of Suzy creates an exhibit that is second to none in terms of mosasaurs and it allows 
	our visitors so see two specimens side-by-side and up close and personal in a spectacular space."
</em> said 	CFDC executive director Peter Cantelon. <br>
<em>
	"Bruce and Suzy have been alone for 80 million and 40 years give or take a few and we think it is
	awesome that we were able to bring them together in this way." <br>
