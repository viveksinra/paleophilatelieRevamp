2009 was both the 200<sup>th</sup> Anniversary or bicentenary of the birth of Charles Robert Darwin, 
and the 150<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the publication of his most famous work 
"On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection".
Many postal authorities around the world, including Ascension Island issued  
<a href="../../topics/paleo/personalities/charles_darwin.html#2009">stamps to celebrate one or both of these a anniversaries</a>. <br>

<br>
Below are quotes from an official press release, published by 
Ascension Island Post Office &amp; Philatelic Bureau in 2009 (unavailable  on their website today). <br>
<br>

<em>
		<a href="../../topics/paleo/contributors.html#darwin">Charles Darwin</a> was born in Shrewsbury, Shropshire 
		in <a href="../../country/uk.html">Great Britain</a> 
		in February 1809, to a wealthy and well-connected family. 
		He had initially planned to study medicine at Edinburgh University but later 
		switched to Divinity at Cambridge. 
		Best known for his theory of evolution, Darwin was fundamental in discovering 
		how all species of life developed from a central ancestor, changing the way we 
		think about how we came to be as humans. 
		He was a naturalist who searched the globe for new species of flora and fauna 
		and then worked on his theory for 20 years before publishing his most famous work, 
		"On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection". <br>

		In 1831, <strong>Charles Darwin</strong> joined a five-year scientific expedition on HMS Beagle, 
		which <strong>visited <a href="../../country/ascension.html">Ascension Island</a>  
		in 1836</strong>. <br>

		It was here that Darwin first heard from his sisters that he was destined for a 
		place among the leading men of science upon his return to England. 
		Darwin, in his autobiography, described how he was so excited at his sisters’ news 
		that he "clambered over the mountains of Ascension with a bounding step and made the 
		volcanic rocks resound under my geological hammer!"<br>
		<br>
		On Ascension it was the geology that interested Darwin, recording his experiences and 
		findings in the third chapter of his "Volcanic Islands". 
		Of particular interest was the Devil’s Riding School, shown on the <a href="#fdc">First Day Cover</a>. <br> 
		Situated on the South Westerly part of Ascension, evidence has revealed that there once
		was a lake but it dried out and subsided in the centre due to volcanic eruptions. 
		Darwin visited the area and collected samples from a layer of pinkish pumiceous ash, 
		which was full of the siliceous remains of diatoms and 25 other types of plant material; 
		evidence to show the lake had existed. <br>
		It was later discovered by other geologists that the volcanic ash beds were composed of finely 
		pulverized rock in sub-horizontal bands of white, pink and buff colour, representing
		successive discrete phases of eruptions. 
		One layer contains the curious concretions called "Devil’s Eyeballs" by islanders, and another
		containing the <strong>abundant remains of organic life</strong>. 
		Darwin was fascinated by the area and that’s why it has become a place of Outstanding Natural
		Beauty and Geological Interest. <br>

		However Darwin’s great breakthrough came when he set foot on 
		<a href="ecuador_1936.html">the Galapagos Archipelago in 1835</a>. 
		This 5 week visit would eventually change the way we see the world, although he didn’t know it at the time. 
		Comprising of more than 200 islands, islets and outcrops in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of
		South America, nearly 9,000 species live on and around the Galapagos Islands. <br>
		An unusually high proportion of these are endemic and some have changed little since prehistoric times. 
		This set from Ascension Island features some of the amazing species that Darwin encountered in
		the Galapagos Islands and which provided the evidence for his controversial theories of evolution 
		and the foundation of modern biology.<br>

<em>
		<strong>Woodpecker Finch</strong><br>
		Darwin observed that several islands had their own form of finch which were all different but closely related.
		Puzzling over these birds, that differed mainly in the size and shape of their beaks, when he was back in London 
		led Darwin towards formulating the principal of natural selection. <br>
		Subsequent research has confirmed Darwin’s belief that a single species had dispersed to different islands and 
		then evolved into at least 13 different species as they adapted to suit different food types in a process known as
		adaptive radiation. 
		As shown on the stamp, the Woodpecker Finch uniquely uses twigs and cactus spines as a tool to compensate for its
		short tongue if it’s unable to dislodge its prey. <br>

		<strong>Marine Iguana</strong><br>
		Darwin wrote that ‘the black Lava rocks on the beach are frequented by large most disgusting clumsy Lizards’. 
		These large (3 feet or more) reptiles, which demonstrate the unique evolution and adaption of Galapagos fauna, 
		must have fascinated Darwin who made extensive observations about them. 
		Looking quite fearsome or ‘hideous’ as Darwin put it, they are in fact harmless. 
		It is one of the most unusual creatures in the Galapagos and the only lizard to swim in the ocean. <br>

<em>		Prior to the arrival of man the tortoise had no predators and the largest thrived, a process called Island Gigantism. 
		Known to live for more than 150 years the tortoise played an important role in Darwin’s theory of evolution as he was to
		learn that tortoises from different islands had noticeably different characteristics. <br>
		<br>

		<strong>£2 Galapagos Penguin</strong> (<em>Spheniscus mendiculus</em>)<br>
		The Galapagos Penguin is endemic to the Galapagos Islands, and the only penguin to live near the Equator. 
		They were brought to the Galapagos by the Humboldt Current, which brings cold waters and nutrients north from Antarctica. 
		The heat is a problem for them. Years with warmer waters from the El Nino Current can see reductions in the small population 
		as it causes a shortfall in the small fish that they eat. 
		To keep themselves cool in the water they will hold out their flippers and on land spread them over their feet to
		protect them from sunburn. <br>
