<br>
On April 15<sup>th</sup> 1958, Post Authority of People Republic of China issued the set 
"Paleontology of China". <br>
<br>
Earlier this year, the first "Chinese" dinosaur was mounted in the Chinese museum: 
<em>Lufengosaurus huenei</em> - the first complete dinosaur skeleton, found and described 
by Chinese scientists, was mounted in 
in <a href="../../topics/paleo/museums.html#bmnh_china">the Paleozoological Museum of China in Beijing</a> 
and was available for public viewing. <br>
The stamps set was issued to commemorate the success of Chinese Paleontology. <br>

<br>
The discovery and research of Chinese dinosaur fossils can be traced back to 1902, 
when a group of fishermen discovered a skeletal fossil in the Heilongjiang River, 
Mandschuria/Manchuria, present-day Northeast China. <br>

This discovery was reported by Russian Colonel Manakin (at this time Manchuria was 
occupied by Russian Empire. Mandschuria returned to China in 1946).

Geologists from the Russian Geological Committee in St. Petersburg visited the area in 1914 and over the 
winter of 1915–1916. <br>

Dinosaur bones were found in situ near the village of Jiayin on the Chinese side
the Heilongjiang river (Amur river in Russian), and excavations followed in the summers of 1916 and 1917. <br>
During these excavations, those Russian scientists discovered a variety of hadrosaur skeletal fossils, and 
named China’s first dinosaur - the <em>Mandschurosaurus amurensis</em>. <br>
The genus name is a combination of the region "Mandschuria" and "saurus", 
the specific name is after the discovery place - Amur river.

The species is now considered a nomen dubium (doubtful name), but the bones described by Riabinin 
nevertheless established the presence of dinosaurs in north-eastern Asia. <br>
The skeleton of the <em>Mandschurosaurus amurensis</em> is on display at the Central 
Geological and Prospecting Museum in St. Petersburg, Russia since 1925. 
Most of the bones of the skeleton are plaster. 
The skull and limb bones have been reconstructed using <em>Thespesius edmontoni</em> 
(<em>Edmontosaurus</em>) and other specimens.<br>
<em>This skeleton is also the first dinosaur discovered and mounted in 
<a href="../../country/russia.html">Russia</a>.</em>
<br>


<br>
During the period of 1922-1923, many more fossils were discovered in China, including theropod teeth, 
the bone plates of a stegosaur,  and incomplete sauropod fossils.  <br>
In 1929, the paleontologist Carl Wiman named the newly discovered <em>Euhelopus</em>, based on fossil 
materials that were discovered in Heilongjiang, Shandong.  <br>
During this same year, Wiman also named another type of hadrosaur - <em>Tanius</em>, which was discovered 
in Laiyang, Shandong. <br>
<br>
Early dinosaur discoveries were accidental, and uncoordinated.  <br>
The first truly large-scale expedition to be launched on the Chinese mainland was conducted in 1922 by 
the American Museum of Natural History, which organized the Third Central Asiatic Expedition.  <br>
The delegation conducted two excavations in Erenhot, Inner Mongolia, during which 
<em>Bactrosaurus johnsoni</em>, <em>Archaeornithomimus asiaticus</em>, and other additional specimens were 
discovered.  <br>
<br>
Another early scientific expedition that was of significant importance occurred during the years 1927-1935 - 
<a href="others/china_1932.html">the Sino-Swedish Expedition</a> a bilateral Chinese-Swedish expedition, 
led by <a href="../../topics/paleo/contributors.html#heidin">Sven Hedin</a>, which carried out scientific 
research in north and northwest China. <br>
Although the expedition was primarily based on archaeology, there were also many important discoveries in 
the field of paleontology.  <br>
For example, one key discovery was the finding and naming of <em>Tienshanosaurus</em>. <br>
Moreover, additional fossils that were discovered during this expedition provided important information 
that would prove valuable for the research of Chinese vertebrate paleontology in the future. <br>
<br>
The true basis for the beginning of paleontological research conducted by Chinese scientists can be traced 
back to Lufeng, Yunnan Province.  
Scientists discovered many precious dinosaur fossils here - take for example 
the <a href="#dinosaur"><em>Lufengosaurus huenei</em></a> (depicted on one of the stamps). 
This particular fossil is the first type of dinosaur to have officially been discovered by Chinese 
scientists.  
Its skeleton fossil was restored and became the first dinosaur skeleton to be featured in an 
exhibition in China. 
Its discovery earned Lufeng of Yunnan Province the reputation of being the “Hometown of Dinosaurs” in China, 
and was the first page to be written with regards to the vast and glorious history of Chinese dinosaur 
research and discovery. <br>

<strong>Trilobites</strong>, meaning "three lobes", are extinct marine arthropods that form the class Trilobita. <br>
Trilobites form one of the earliest known groups of arthropods. <br>
The first appearance of trilobites in the fossil record defines the base of the Atdabanian stage 
of the Early Cambrian period (521 million years ago) and they flourished throughout the lower Paleozoic 
before slipping into a long decline, when, during the Devonian, all trilobite orders except the Proetida died out. <br>
The last extant trilobites finally disappeared in the mass extinction at the end of the Permian about 252 million years ago.  <br>
Trilobites were among the most successful of all early animals, existing in oceans for almost 270 million years, 
with over 22,000 species having been described. <br>
By the time trilobites first appeared in the fossil record, they were already highly diversified and 
geographically dispersed. <br>
Because trilobites had wide diversity and an easily fossilized exoskeleton, they left an extensive fossil record. <br>
the largest trilobites were more than 45 centimetres long and may have weighed as much as 4.5 kilograms. <br>
The trilobite on the stamp is
<strong><em>Kaolishania pustulosa</em></strong> - trilobite from the Paleozoic era, 
found in Haoli Mountain of China. <br>
It was a small trilobite with an average length between 1.0 and 1.50 centimetres. <br>

A fossil of <em>Kaolishania pustulosa</em> is shown on the foreground of the stamp 
and a reconstruction of the animal swimming is present in the background.  <br>
This stamp is <a href="../../milestones.html">the first trilobite stamp</a> issued in the world. <br>

In 1958 a specimen of <em>Lufengosaurus huenei</em> was the first complete dinosaur skeleton mounted in 
China in <a href="../../topics/paleo/museums.html#bmnh_china">the Paleozoological Museum of China in Beijing</a>.
Some articles suggests, this event was the trigger for the issue of this stamp set.  <br>
<br>
<strong><em>Lufengosaurus</em></strong>, is a genus of sauropodomorph dinosaur
from the Early and Middle Jurassic Period of what is now southwestern China. <br>
The type species, <em>Lufengosaurus huenei</em>, was discovered in the Lower Lufeng 
Formation of the Yunnan Province in China. <br>
It was described and named by Chinese paleontologist Yang Zhongjian, also known as C. C. Young, 
who has been called the "Father of Chinese Vertebrate Paleontology", in 1941: 
<em>Lufengosaurus huenei</em> <br>
The generic name referring to Lufeng where it was found, 
the specific name honoring Young's old tutor, the German paleontologist Friedrich von Huene.
(In 1927, Young  received his doctorate from the University of Munich in Germany.) <br>

The second species of the dinosaur, <em>Lufengosaurus magnus</em>, was also named by Young in 1940 in 
the same paper as <em>Lufengosaurus huenei</em> and would be fully described by him in 1947. 
As its specific name suggests, with the word magnus meaning "the large one" in Latin. <br>
A reconstruction of  <em>Lufengosaurus magnus</em> was featured on one of the 
"<a href="hong_kong_2014.html">Chinese Dinosaurs</a>" stamps issued in 
<a href="../../country/hong_kong.html">Hong Kong</a> in 
<a href="../../year/2014.html">2014</a>. <br>

<p>
	Yang's scientific work was instrumental in the creation of 
	<a href="../../topics/paleo/museums.html#bmnh_china">China's Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology 
	and Paleoanthropology in Beijing</a>, which today houses one of the most important collections of fossil 
	vertebrates in the world and where the <em>Lufengosaurus</em> skeleton was mounted.

<em>Lufengosaurus</em> was about 6 meters long. 
This dinosaur had long hindlimbs and shorter forelimbs. <br>
It was most likely bipedal at least part of the time, especially when foraging for food. <br>
<em>Lufengosaurus</em> was an herbivore, although it had very sharp claws and teeth. 
There are some claims that it may have been a possible omnivore based on its claws and teeth.<br> 
However, the sharp teeth seen in <em>Lufengosaurus</em> are similar to the teeth seen in
herbivorous lizards of today, such as the iguana. <br>
The claws of the dinosaur may have been used solely for defense or possibly for raking
foliage from the trees.  <br>

Over the years there have been many cases of fossils being 
<a href="https://www.thatsmags.com/china/post/27096/uncovering-china-s-illegal-dinosaur-fossil-trade">illegally exported out of China</a> 
and being sold in other countries like the US.

This stamp is the second stamp of prehistoric mammal, issued in the world.
<a href="../../milestones.html">The first prehistoric mammal stamp</a> was issued in 
<a href="india_1951.html">India in 1951</a> and shows a pair of <em>Stegodon ganesa</em>. <br>
<br>	
<em>Sinomegaceros</em> is an extinct genus of deer known from the Early to Late 
Pleistocene of Central and East Asia. 
It is considered to be part of the group of "giant deer" 
(often referred to collectively as members of the tribe Megacerini), with a probable close relationship 
to <a href="../../topics/paleo/vertebrate/megaloceros.html"><em>Megaloceros</em></a>. <br>
Many members of the genus are noted for their distinctive palmate antler brow tines. <br>
<em>Sinomegaceros</em> was a big deer, 2.2 meter in length, 1.50 meter in height and 
weighing 400 kilograms.
Its antlers were 1.6 meters wide. <br>

The first species of the genus <em>Sinomegaceros ordosianus</em> and <em>Sinomegaceros pachyosteus</em> 
were named by pioneering Chinese paleontologist C. C. Young, 
who also described the dinosaur <em>Lufengosaurus</em>, shown on 
another stamp of this set, in 1932. <br> 
The fossils of  <em>Sinomegaceros</em>, described by Young,  were discovered at the 
famous Zhoukoudian site. <br>

<p>
	<a href="../../topics/anthro/sites.html#zhoukoudian"><strong>Zhoukoudian Peking Man Site</strong></a>, 
    archaeological site near the village of Zhoukoudian, Beijing municipality, China, 42 km southwest 
	of the central city. <br>
	The site, including some four residential areas, has yielded the largest known collection of 
	fossils of the extinct hominin <em>Homo erectus</em> — altogether some 40 incomplete skeletons, 
	which are commonly known as the Peking man fossils.  <br>
    Remains of anatomically modern humans (<em>Homo sapiens</em>) have also been excavated there. 
    The discoveries at Zhoukoudian have proved vital to advancing the study of human evolution. <br>
</p>

In 1936, a French Jesuit priest, scientist, paleontologist, theologian, philosopher and teacher,
<a href="../../topics/paleo/paleontologist.html#deChardin">Pierre Teilhard de Chardin</a> described 
the third species of  <em>Sinomegaceros</em> - <em>Sinomegaceros flabellatus</em>.
Fossils of this deer were also discovered at the Zhoukoudian site by digging for the 
Peking man fossils. <br>
(Pierre Teilhard de Chardin was featured on several stamps and postmarks of 
 <a href="../../country/france.html">France</a>, 
 <a href="../../country/belgium.html">Belgium</a> and 
 <a href="../../country/france.html">Jersey</a>. 
 Some of them can be see below) <br>
