On November 7<sup>th</sup>, 2024 the Post Authority of Switzerland issued the set of two stamps 
"Giants of the Ice Age" depicting woolly rhinoceros (<em>Coelodonta antiquitatis</em>) 
and <a href="../../topics/paleo/vertebrate/mammoth.html">woolly mammoth</a> (<em>Mammuthus primigenius</em>). <br>
<br>
These stamps were printed in separate <a href="#ms">Mini-Sheets</a> of 10 with text and decorations 
on the margins and in combined  <a href="#ms">Souvenir-Sheet</a> 
of 4 with the selvage in the shape of both Ice Age animals standing next to each other. <br>

FDCs were issued in three formats: 
   small (C6) and big (C5) <a href="#fdc1">white covers</a> with 1 or 4 stamps each cancelled by 
   black ink <a href="#pm1">First-Day-of-Issue Postmark</a>; 
   big (C5), <a href="#fdc2">numbered, cover</a> with illustration of a landscape with two stamps cancelled by silver ink 
   First-Day-of-Issue Postmark and text written in silver ink on the bottom-left side. <br>
Some covers were cancelled by "<a href="#pm2">Witnesses of the Ice Age</a>" (Zeugen der Eiszeit) postmark 
of <span lang="de">Fällanden</span>, first <a href="../../images/pm/switzerland_1999_pm.jpg">introduced on January 2<sup>nd</sup> 1999</a>. <br>


<p>
	<q><em>The <a href="../../topics/paleo/vertebrate/mammoth.html">woolly mammoth</a> has captured the hearts of Internet users.
	The design featuring this animal, part of the “Giants of the Ice Age” series, 
	was voted the most beautiful stamp of 2024 [in Switzerland]. 
	This stamp invites you to travel back in time and discover the prehistoric animal kingdom. 
	The presence of the mammoth in Switzerland has been documented at many sites and dates back around 115,000 years. <br>

            <br>
			The woolly mammoth (<em>Mammuthus primigenius</em>) is a representative of the family
			<em>Elephantidae</em>, adapted to the cold climate of the Ice Age. 

            The earliest woolly mammoths date to 800,000 years ago and they went extinct about 10,500 years 
			ago in Europe and North America.

			
			 The extinction coincides with the dramatically changing climate at the end of Ice Age. 
			These changes reduced the wide grass steppes, the specific habitat of the mammoth. 
			Only on the small Wrangel Island in the northern Arctic Sea, a population of dwarf-mammoths 
			survived until about 4.000 years ago.<br>
			<br>
			An average male mammoth measured 3.00–3.50 m at the shoulder and had the dimension of the recent Asian elephant. 
			It weighed 4–5 tons. 
			The biggest bulls stood up to 4 m tall and reached the dimensions of the present-day African elephant. <br> 
			His food consisted of about 200 kg of plant material such as grass, leaves, branches, together with 
			more than 100 litres of water per day. 
			The mammoth was characterized by two big tusks and six generations of molar teeth.
			The mammoth had a 3 cm thick skin and 9 cm thick layer of fat as protection against low temperature. 
			The 4–5 cm long woolly hairs of the under-fur were covered by a thicker fur made up of 1 m long hair. 
			Small ears and a short tail were other adaptions to the extremely cold winter.<br>
			In comparison with the recent African elephant, the mammoth probably lived for 50–70 years. 
			Mammoth achieved sexual maturity by about 10 years. 
			After a gestation time of about 22 months, young animals were probably born in spring time. <br>

		<td width="50%">
			<big>Woolly Rhinoceros</big><br>
            <br>
			The woolly rhinoceros (<em>Coelodonta antiquitatis</em>) is an extinct species of rhinoceros that was 
			native to Europe, North Africa, and Asia during the Pleistocene Epoch (5.3 million to 11,700 years ago).
			<br>
			The animal was massive, with two large horns toward the front of the skull, and was covered with a 
			thick coat of hair, that allowed it to survive in the extremely cold.
			It had a massive hump reaching from its shoulder and fed mainly on herbaceous plants that grew in the steppe. <br>
			<br>
			 An adult woolly rhinoceros typically measured 3.2 to 3.6 metres from head to tail, stood 1.45–1.6 metres tall at the withers, 
			 and weighed up to 1.5–2.0 making it comparable in size to the largest living rhinoceros species. <br>
			 Both males and females had two horns which were made of keratin, 
			 with one long horn reaching forward and a smaller horn between the eyes.
			 Unlike in modern rhinos, the large nasal horn was often flattened in cross-section, 
			 and abrasion patterns on the horn indicate its possible use in brushing away snow when grazing. <br>
			 Compared to other rhinoceroses, the woolly rhinoceros had a longer head and body, and shorter legs. 
			 Its shoulder was raised with a powerful hump, used to support the animal's massive front horn. 
			 The hump also contained a fat reserve to aid survival through the desolate winters of the mammoth steppe.

			 The species became extinct at the end of the Last Glacial Period, with its decline probably predominantly 
			 driven by unfavourable environmental change caused by a warming climate.

There is evidence for the existence of these long-haired heavyweights at around 100 locations 
in the valleys of the Swiss Plateau and Jura Mountains. 
They lived where the glaciers receded during the warmer periods of the Ice Age, giving way to
a grassy steppe – the ideal environment for mammoth's fauna. <br>


The earliest mammoth bones in Switzerland were found in 1577 near the monastery of Reiden, known later in the literature
as the "<em>Giant of Reiden</em>", "<em>Giant of Lucerne</em>" or "<em>Swiss Giant</em>".<br>


In “<em>Geschichte der Mammutfunde</em>”, Professor Arnold Lang (1855-1914), a Swiss naturalist, 
comparative anatomist, and student of the German biologist Ernst Haeckel, describes the story of their 
discovery.


<p>
In 1577, huge bones were found in village Reyden in the canton of Lucerne 
by brothers of the local monastery under an oak tree that had been uprooted by a storm.
Many bones were damaged, the rest were brought to Lucerne.
When the famous doctor Felix Plater was called to Lucerne in 1584 to care for the sick military colonel Ludwig Pfyffer, 
the councillors showed him these bones - as Plater himself tells us in his "<em>Observationes medicete</em>".
He examined them and could not believe that they were anything other than the bones of a giant. 
<br>
The council decided to send him some of the larger pieces to Basel, where Plater compared them with the human skeleton pieces 
in his possession and was confirmed in his belief that they were the bones of a human giant, with heigh of 5.5 meters. 
Plater then had the Basel master painter Hans Bock, 
an artist who happened to be painting his portrait at the time,
make a drawing of the bones that had been reconstructed and supplemented 
to form a gigantic human skeleton and sent the drawing back to Lucerne along with the bones. 
</p>

Because giants were not part of any local traditions, it was believed that the creature must have lived 
and died in a prehistoric era, long before modern humans arrived in the region.

The inhabitants of Reiden and Lucerne were so proud of their giant that he was immortalised on one of 
the panels of the Chapel Bridge at the beginning of the 17<sup>th</sup> century.
The giant  adorns the first bridge painting at the entrance to the Chapel Bridge on the left bank of the Reuss. 
The painting shows the giant in a threatening gesture. 
In his right hand he holds up a torn-out oak tree (see on the right), with a Swiss pikeman for 
the giant size comparison. <br>

The bones were displayed in the city hall, and the giant was adopted as the shield-bearer on 
the city's coat of arms. 
His image was painted on the towers adjoining the city hall, and local authors composed poems recounting 
the story of his discovery. <br>

<br>
In 1799, the famous naturalist Johann Friedrich Blumenbach (1752-1840) from Goettingen (today Germany)
recognized these fossils as bones of a mammoth and took two of the bones for further study with him.
The cast of these bones can be seen in the Natural History Museum in Luzern today. 
The misidentification of Plater came from the similarities of the foot bones of the mammals: 
elephant (who wasn't known in Switzerland in 16<sup>th</sup> century) and human and while the skull and 
tusks of the mammoth were not discovered with the foot bones. <br>
<br>
	

Other historical mammoth fossils were found in sand and gravel pits of the Swiss midlands from Geneva to Lake Constance in 1700 - 
a large number of elephant bones were excavated, including no more than 60 tusks.
The more beautiful pieces were kept, the others went to the court pharmacy to heal the sick as it was believed these fossil ivory 
have some magical properties. <br>

More than 200 bones and teeth of the <a href="../../topics/paleo/vertebrate/mammoth.html">woolly mammoth</a> are known since 1769 
from the region of Basel and more than 60 from Kanton Zurich since 1821 respectively. <br>
In 1969, 14 000 years old, mammoth fossils were discovered at a gravel pit of Praz-Rodet in the 
<span lang="fr">Vallée de Joux</span> in north western Switzerland.
The mounted skeleton can be seen in the <span lang="fr">Musée cantonal de géologie</span> in Lausanne today. <br>

<h3>Niederweningen site</h3>

One of the most important sites of Ice Age animals in Switzerland is Niederweningen in Kanton Zurich.  <br>
<br>
In summer 1890, when a thin bed of gravel was exploited for the construction of the new railway embankment, 
more than 100 bones, molar teeth and tusks of at least seven different individuals of mammoths, 
including a neonatal  calf of about 2 months age, were discovered in a peat horizon at the base of a 
gravel pit at the village of Niederweningen, 20km northwest of Zurich. <br>
<br>

When the bones were discovered, the workers carefully collected each bone and took it to the local inn 
for storage. 
By the beginning of August, it was clear that there were a lot of bones there. 
The minister of the church in nearby Dielsdorf, Pastor Schluep, sent a telegram to the president of 
the Zurich Antiquarian Society telling him about the find. <br>

Professor Arnold Lang from the Zurich University arrived in Niederweningen on the next work day, 
to examine the site.
In a mere two weeks he organized and conducted a full excavation of the site. 
During that time, he not only collected bones, he also brought in experts to examine the geological context  
and botanical remains associated with the bones. 
The excavation continued to the summer of the following year and was led by the zoologist Dr. Arnold Lang 
from Zurich University. <br>

Further fragmentary fossils are identiﬁed as remains of 
<a href="#rhino"><strong>woolly rhino</strong></a> (<em>Coelodonta antiquitatis</em>), 
wild horse (<em>Equus przewalskii</em>), 
bison (<a href="mongolia_2023.html#bison"><em>Bison priscus</em></a>), 
wolf (<a href="ireland_1999.html#wolf"><em>Canis lupus</em></a>), 
lemming (<em>Lemmus lemmus</em>), 
vole (<em>Arvicola terrestris</em>), 
frog (<em>Rana temporaria</em>) and a bird. <br>


In 1892, Herr Dreyer, one of the experts Lang recruited, used bones from all the adult mammoths to assemble 
a composite skeleton, from bones of six individuals, which was mounted and displayed in the zoology museum at the University of Zurich.
The mammoth was mounted in the same posture as the famous <a href="russia_2020.html#mammoth">Adam's Mammoth</a> (with tusks by sides) - 
the first mounted and exhibited for the public in 1808 in  St. Petersburg, 
with tusks placed on the wrong sides. <br>

<p class="notes">
	The first mammoth skeleton mounted in West Europe was the "<a href="belgium_2018.html#mammoth">Lier Mammoth</a>" 
	from Belgium - discovered in 1860 near the Dungelhoeffkazerne in Lier in the Province of Antwerp.
	Shown for the public in the first time in 1869, it was the only second mounted Mammoth skeleton 
	in the world and the first Mammoth fossils found outside of permafrost region of Siberia.
</p>

<!-- 
Since 1914 the Niederweningen mammoth has been one of the highlights of the Zoological Museum 
in the new building of the University.
-->
Dreyer's composite skeleton is still in Zurich, in 1991, the skeleton was remounted according to recent 
anatomical knowledge. <br>
<!-- why it took 80 years to correct it? -->


<br>
In July 2003, the lower jaw of a mammoth was discovered in a construction site at Murzelen street, 
only 100 meters west of the original mammoth site. 
In an emergency 3-week excavation, the Palaeontological Institute and Museum of the University of Zurich 
and the Archaeological Survey of Kanton Zurich recovered teeth and bones of a partially, about 50% complete,  
articulated  mammoth skeleton.
The dimensions of the limb bones and the tusks suggest the animal’s height at the withers was 
about 3.5 meters.

Recent radiocarbon analysis of these bones, wood and peat samples  indicate
that the mammoth, perished at the age of approximately 40 years and 
it sank in the bog of Niederweningen approx. 45.000 years ago. <br>
The peat swamp of Niederweningen developed in a relatively open landscape with marshes and wet meadows
in a periodically ﬂooded valley plain at the edge of a silting up lake in the Wehn Valley during an interstadial period.
At the beginning of the peat formation climate conditions were not favourable for tree growth as indicated 
by the low content and assemblage of tree pollen. <br>

In March and April of the following year another construction pit, called "Mammutweg", was opened at 
Niederweningen, just at the western end of the original mammoth site.
This time several disarticulated bones, probably, originally from an old male mammoth,
and several other prehistoric animals, including hyena (<em>Crocuta crocuta spelaea</em>) were found there. <br>


<!-- 
In 2007, the original fossils were copied and the skeleton was completed to a worldwide unique 
reconstruction of a very young mammoth.
-->

<br>
In October 2005 the Mammutmuseum Niederweningen (literally: Mammoth Museum Niederweningen)
was established after successful crowdfunding campaign. 
The highlights of the museum are the reconstructions of a mammoth calf skeleton, based on fossils from 1890 and 
the skeleton of an adult animal, based on the bones discovered in 2003. 
The reconstruction of the pair was shown on one of the postage stamps (see on the right). <br>

In October 2015 an interactive multimedia installation for the visitors was inaugurated, when the exhibition was renewed 
on occasion of the museum's 10<sup>th</sup> anniversary. 
The museum also houses the geological project "Eiszeiten und Klimawandel der vergangenen 500 000 Jahre im Wehntal" 
(in English: "Ice ages and climate change in the past 500,000 years in the Wehntal"), 
that researched the climate change and glacial periods of the last 500,000 years in the Wehn valley. <br>

One of the earliest scientific descriptions of an ancient rhinoceros species was made in 1769, 
when the naturalist <a href="../../country/russia.html#PS4">Peter Simon Pallas</a> wrote a report 
on his expeditions to Siberia where he found a skull and two horns in the permafrost. 
In 1772, Pallas acquired a head and two legs of a rhinoceros from the locals in Irkutsk, and named the species 
<em>Rhinoceros lenenesis</em> (after the Lena River). <br>
In 1799, Johann Friedrich Blumenbach studied rhinoceros bones from the collection of the University of Goettingen, 
and proposed the scientific name <em>Rhinoceros antiquitatis</em>.<br>
Woolly rhinoceros remains have been known long before the species was described and were the basis for 
some mythical creatures. 
Native peoples of Siberia believed their horns were the claws of giant birds. <br>

<br>
A rhinoceros skull was found in Klagenfurt, <a href="../../country/austria.html">Austria</a>, in 1335, 
and was believed to be that of a dragon. 

<p class="notes">
	The legend has it that Klagenfurt was founded after a couple of brave men had slain the abominable 
	"Lindwurm", a winged dragon in the moors adjoining the lake, the staple diet of which is said 
	to have been virgins, but which did not spurn the fat bull on a chain that the men had mounted on a 
	strong tower. <br>
	In 1335 the skull (cranium) of a woolly rhinoceros from the ice-age was found in a gravel pit near Klagenfurt. 
    It was instantly interpreted as the skull of the dragon.
</p>

In 1840 the palaeontologist Franz UNGER Identified it as the cranium of the woolly rhinoceros <em>Coelodonta antiquitatis</em>.
This fossil, which is still on exhibit at the Landesmuseum fuer Kaernten, served as a model for 
the head of the fountain which was installed on the central square of the city, erected by Ulrich Vogelsang in 1590.
Although it represents a dragon, it can be regarded as the first palaeontological reconstruction. <br>

<br>
In Switzerland fossils of woolly rhino were discovered not only in <a href="#mammoth">Niederweningen</a>, but in several other locations 
across the country: Bern, Bumbach, Langenthal, Wischberg, Laufen, Moutier, Delemont, Rickenbach, Goldau, Hohe Rhone and Lausanne, among others.
<ul>
	<li>In 1850, skulls, jaws, individual bones and teeth were discovered in Bern.
	    Paleontologists think these fossils were swept away by water after death and washed together.	
	</li>
	<li>Several molars of the animal were discovered in the north-east of Switzerland and 
		are in the collection and on display at the Natural History Museum 
		of Olten (approx. 70km north-east of Bern).</li>
	<li>In 1991, a well-preserved skull of a woolly rhinoceros was discovered in Vaumarcus, canton Neuchatel, during dredge works in the lake.
		It was discovered at the depth of 30 meters and its age was estimated 14.000 years old. <br>
		This skull of a young animal, probably comes from a body which was transported by the Ruz de la Vaux, a tributary of the lake that 
		forms a delta in Vaumarcus, or by lake streams, and sank after the decomposition of the soft body parts.</li>
</ul>
