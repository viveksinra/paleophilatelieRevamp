On June 24<sup>th</sup>, 2009, the Post Authority of Pitcairn Islands issued 
the set of  four stamps "Bicentenary of the birth of Charles Darwin". 
These stamps were printed in Sheets of 30 stamps: 
2 panes of 15 stamps with a central gutter showing the HMS Beagle. <br>
<br>

<br>
<em>
The following text is a quote from the press release published by
Postal Bureau of Pitcairn Islands in 2009 with additional text about the 
Toxodon skull added by the <a href="../../about.html">author of this website</a>.
</em>
<br>

<br>
2009 is both the 200<sup>th</sup> Anniversary or bicentenary of the birth of the greatest naturalist in
history, <a href="../../topics/paleo/contributors.html#darwin">Charles Robert Darwin</a>  (1809-1882), 
and the 150<sup>th</sup> Anniversary of the publication of his most famous work 
"On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection". <br>
<br>
Born in Shrewsbury, Darwin studied at Edinburgh University and Christs College, Cambridge, 
before embarking at the age of 22 on a five-year journey to South America, 
<a href="ecuador_1936.html">the Galapagos Islands</a> and beyond, aboard the HMS Beagle.<br> 
At this time, most Europeans believed that the world was created by God in
seven days as described in the Bible. 
On the voyage Darwin read Lyell's "Principles of Geology" which suggested that the fossils 
found in rocks were actually evidence of animals that had lived thousands or even
millions of years ago. 
The animal life and geological features that he saw on the voyage reinforced Lyell's argument 
and Darwin linked the fossils to modern species.<br>

Upon his return to England, Darwin conducted thorough research of his notes
and specimens and out of this long study grew several related theories:<br>
<br>

<img style="border: 0px solid ; width: 311px; height: 134px; float: right;" 
     title="The origin of species"
	 alt="The origin of species" 
	 src="../../images/details/stamps/official/pitcairn_isl/2009/preview/DawinBook.jpg"
	hspace="4">

<ul>
	<li>Evolution did occur</li>
	<li>Evolutionary change was gradual, requiring millions of years</li>
	<li>The primary mechanism for evolution was a process called natural selection</li>
	<li>The millions of species alive today arose from a single original life form evolving 
		through a branching process called speciation</li>
</ul>
<br>


<br>
Darwin's theory of evolutionary selection holds that variation within species occurs randomly 
and that the survival or extinction of each organism is determined by that organisms ability to
adapt to its environment. 
This theory of evolution by natural selection underlies all modern biology.<br>
At times controversial, the theory remains  unchallenged as the central concept of biology 
and it profoundly altered our view of the natural world and our place in it. <br>

The stamp with face value of 50c show Charles Darwin with a fossilized skull of <strong>Toxodon</strong>. <br>
<br>

<strong><em>Toxodon</em></strong>, meaning "bow tooth" in reference to the curvature 
of the teeth, is an extinct genus of South American mammal from the Late Miocene 
to early Holocene epochs who lived from 11.6 million to 11,000 years ago. <br>

<em>Toxodon</em> was described in 1837 by Richard Owen based on remains 
collected by Darwin.<br>

<em>Toxodon</em>  was about 2.7 meters  in body length, with an estimated weight up to 1,415 kg 
and about 1.5 meter high at the shoulder and resembled a heavy rhinoceros, 
with a short and vaguely hippopotamus-like head. <br>

Evidence suggests that <em>Toxodon</em> was ecologically plastic and able to 
adapt its diet to local conditions. <br>

<br>
Charles Darwin was one of the first to collect <em>Toxodon</em> fossils, 
after paying 18 pence for a <em>Toxodon platensis</em> skull from a farmer in 
<a href="../../country/uruguay.html">Uruguay</a>, during his visit to the country 
on the voyage of the HMS Beagle.<br>

This skull was one of the many spectacular fossils Darwin sent home from South America. 
Some boys in a remote village in Uruguay had used the skull for target practice and knocked 
a tooth out with a stone. <br>

<br>
In "The Voyage of the Beagle" Darwin wrote, <br>
<p style="margin-top: 0;">
 "November 26<sup>th</sup> – I set out on my return in a direct line for Montevideo. 
 Having heard of some giant's bones at a neighbouring farm-house on the Sarandis, 
 a small stream entering the Rio Negro, I rode there accompanied by my host 
  and purchased for the value of eighteen pence the head of the <em>Toxodon</em>."
</p>
Since Darwin discovered that the fossils of similar mammals of South America were different from those in Europe, 
he invoked many debates about the evolution and natural selection of animals. <br>
<br>
Paleontologist <a href="../../topics/paleo/paleontologist.html#owen">Richard Owen</a> 
analyzed the fossil mammals from the Beagle voyage. 
This life-sized lithograph of the <em>Toxodon</em> skull by artist George Scharf 
was part of the Zoology of the Voyage of H.M.S. Beagle, edited by Darwin. <br>

This skull was one of the many spectacular fossils Darwin sent home from South America. 
Some boys in a remote village in Uruguay had used the skull for target practice and knocked 
a tooth out with a stone. 
Darwin bought it from them and was pleased to find a "perfect tooth, which exactly fitted 
one of the sockets in this skull," 200 miles away. 
This particular animal belongs to a group without modern descendants, but many of Darwin's fossils 
seemed to be huge variants of the same general kind of animal he had seen roaming the
landscape during his explorations. 
This led him to wonder if the fossils might be evidence of ancestral forms. 
In later years Darwin would write that the South American fossils were essential to the
"origin of all my views." <br>

Paleontologist <a href="../../topics/paleo/paleontologist.html#owen">Richard Owen</a> 
analyzed the fossil mammals from the Beagle voyage. 
This life-sized lithograph of the <em>Toxodon</em> skull by artist George Scharf 
was part of the Zoology of the Voyage of H.M.S. Beagle, edited by Darwin. 
In it the young naturalist described the habitats and behaviours of the living species 
he had collected, and the localities from which his fossils had come. 
This book was only part of Darwin's scientific output during the London years. 
He also wrote a treatise on coral reef formation and the wildly popular 
Journal of Researches, based on his shipboard journals. <br>
