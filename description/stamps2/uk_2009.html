Ten colourful Philately
celebrates the 200th anniversary of <span style="font-weight: bold;">Charles
Darwin</span>'s birth and the 150th anniversary of On
the Origin of Species.<br>
Julietta Edgar, head of special
stamps, Royal Mail, said: "Charles Darwin's ideas triggered a
revolution in the understanding of how species evolve. The brilliance
of his thinking is symbolised in the unique design of the stamps the
jigsaw shape suggests how Darwin was able to draw on his different
areas of study to formulate groundbreaking new ideas."<br>
Royal Mail also issued a
separate set of tamper-proof stamps today, which have improved security
features to stop users peeling used stamps from envelopes which have
not been franked and reusing them.<br>
Part
of a sticky film covering
the stamp will remain on the envelope and thwart fraudsters. The new
stamps will also be printed on the same tamper-proof paper used for
currency. They are called the Machin stamps, named in honour of the
(late) artist Arnold Machin, who created the classic image of the Queen
which features on British stamps and coins.<br>
<a href="../../images/details/stamps/official/uk/2009/uk_2009_darwin_1.jpg"><img title="Charles Darwin on stamp of UK 2009" style="border: 0px solid ; width: 250px; height: 236px; float: left;" alt="Charles Darwin on stamp of UK 2009" src="../../images/details/stamps/official/uk/2009/preview/uk_2009_darwin_1.jpg" hspace="6"></a>
The Royal Mail's
stamps commemorate Darwin and the areas of study which inspired his
ideas on evolution:
zoology, botany, geology, ornithology and anthropology. The six
"jigsaw" shape stamps symbolise how his studies of different
disciplines came together to form new ideas on evolution.<br>
<br>
1st class
shows a portrait of the man himself while the others show Darwin's
areas of study that helped to contribute to his ideas on evolution:
Zoology, Ornithology, Geology, Botany and Anthropology through a
mixture of present day photography and relevant archive material from
Darwin's time.<br>
Born at the Mount,
Shrewsbury on 12 February 1809, Darwin studied at both Edinburgh and
Christ's College, Cambridge before in 1831, aged just 22, he embarked
on a five year journey to south America, and beyond, aboard the HMS
Beagle. He died on 19 April 1882 at Down House, Downe, Kent. More than
two decades after his return he
eventually published On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural
Selection in 1859. Darwin wanted to unravel 'the mystery of mysteries -
the first appearance of new beings on Earth', and his book immediately
challenged the established beliefs concerning evolution that were
commonly held at the time, triggering a scientific revolution that
still causes debate today.<br>

Royal Mail has also produced a <a href="../../images/details/stamps/official/uk/2009/uk_2009_darwin_ms.jpg">special
sheet</a> of four stamps illustrating the unique wildlife of the
Galpagos
Islands that includes the Flightless
Cormorant, Giant
Tortoise, Floreana
Mockingbird and Marine
Iguana, and which builds up into a contemporary map of the
Galpagos Islands with the key species Darwin studied in the 1830s
during his voyage
as Ship's Naturalist on the hydrographic
survey ship HMS Beagle. The animals of these
isolated islands and how they showed evidence of variation and
evolution had a profound influence upon Darwin's theory of natural
selection. The animals are shown against the background of the map
produced on the mission by Captain
Robert Fitzroy.<br>
