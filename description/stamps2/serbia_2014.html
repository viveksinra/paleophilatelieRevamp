On October 8<sup>th</sup>, 2014, the Post Authority of Serbia in cooperation with the Natural History 
Museum of Belgrade, issued the set of 2  stamps, in the series "Science", to commemorate 
Centenary of geologuit and paleontologist Petar Stefanovic (1914-1999) and 
Bicentenary of botanist Josif Pancic (1814-1888).<br>

<br>
<em>
	The text about both scientists is based on the text published on the 
	<a href="../../images/details/stamps/official/serbia/2014/serbia_2014_fdc_back.jpg">reverse side of the FDC covers</a>.
	The text about fossilized shells of shellfish <em>Lymnocardium</em> sp. is based on

<br>
<strong>PETAR STEVANOVIC</strong> (1914–1999), was professor of geology at the University of Belgrade, 
member of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts, President of the Serbian Geological Society and 
scientist with high international reputation, was the last student of the prominent Serbian geologist 
Jovan Zujovic. <br>

His career began at the Natural History Museum in Belgrade in 1938, as curator and the head of Geological and 
<strong>Paleontological</strong> as well as Mineralogical-petrological departments. <br>
The period of World War II (1941-1945), Stevanovic spent imprisoned in the Osnabruck labour camp, Germany.
Pedagogical and scientific activities commenced at the Faculty of Philosophy in Belgrade in 1946. 
Stevanovic defended his PhD thesis “<em>The Lower Pliocene of Serbia and neighbouring areas</em>” 
at the Moscow Paleontological Institute (<a href="../../country/ussr.html">USSR</a>) in 1948. 
He lectured on the following subjects:
Introduction to independent geological-paleontological investigations,
Stratigraphy of Yugoslavia, the Quaternary geology. 

Petar Stevanovic was the author of the textbooks: 
<em>"Historical Geology II-the Paleozoic Periods",
    "Historical Geology-the Cenozoic Periods and the Quaternary Geology"</em>.<br>

In the field of Neogene stratigraphy of Pannonian Basen, he has introduced the two new substages 
(time-intervals), the Portaferrian (the Upper Pontian) and the Serbian (the Upper Pannonian) and
identified forty taxa, new to science (bivalve and gastropod species and subspecies). 
During his long-lasting geological field research, he discovered new fossiliferous localities of different 
geological age in the Belgrade area, Kolubara Basin, Kostolac, Krupanj, Koceljeva, 
Loznica and Timočka krajina. <br>
Good knowledge of several languages (Russian, French, German) enabled Stevanovic to follow successfully the
achievements in geosciences and to participate in many international expert teams and committees. 
His first scientific article was issued in 1937, and up to 1999. 
During his career Stevanovic published more than 200 scientific and professional papers. 
He was appointed as a member of the Yugoslav Academy of Sciences and Arts, the Slovenian Academy of Sciences 
and Arts, and the Academy of Sciences of Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well as the honorary member of
the Hungarian Geological Society and the Paleontological Society of the German Federal Republic. <br>

Stevanovic's successful and fruitful work has been awarded by several orders and rewards 
(Order of Labor with the Golden Wreath, two October Prizes of City of Belgrade, “Seventh July Prize”).
Owing to the great working capacity and self-discipline, he has achieved excellent scientific outcomes 
and made significant contributions to: 
developing and enhancing the geology school and geological education in Serbia, 
teaching and training of generations of geologists and paleontologists promoting and popularizing 
the geology and geosciences; 
developing the museology, and conserving and preserving the geological heritage of Serbia.<br>
<br>

<strong>Two fossilized shells</strong> of shellfish <em>Lymnocardium sp</em>. can be seen 
on the top-right side of the stamp of  Petar Stevanovic, First-Day-of-Issue Postmark and 
on the cachet of the FDC with stamp of Petar Stevanovic. <br>

These shells are from the fossil collection of Petar Stevanovic, which is on display
at Geology Department of the <a href="serbia_2020.html">Natural History Museum in Belgrade</a>.  <br>
This collection includes over 300.000 fossilized invertebrate remains, mostly of Tertiary
age, from the territory of 
Balkans, 
<a href="../../country/czech.html">Czech Republic</a>, 
<a href="../../country/austria.html">Austria</a>, 
<a href="../../country/hungary.html">Hungary</a>,
<a href="../../country/romania.html">Romania</a>, 
<a href="../../country/italy.html">Italy</a> and 
<a href="../../country/iran.html">Iran</a>. 

It was established in 1939 as a legacy of Academy Member Petar Stevanovic (1914-1999), 
who spent first several years of his long working life at the Natural History Museum. 
The best represented group is of Neogene age (up to 15 million years ago). 
Besides the mollusks, this collection also includes fossilized remains of other
invertebrate groups (trilobites and crinoids, several million years ago) well as microfauna, etc. <br>
The youngest specimens in geological sense are representatives of Quaternary
mollusks (up to several tens of years ago). 
As Petar Stevanovic spent most of his working life at Faculty of Mining and Geology, 
the collection also includes the material collected for students’ Bachelor Theses. 
Most important part of the collection includes the holotypes of taxa new for science, as well as the rare
species. <br> 
Most of the collection was used to prepare the edition Geology of Serbia (1977) as well as other expert 
and scientific works, primarily in the fields of stratigraphy and paleontology, but also
paleoecology, paleogeography etc. <br>

<strong>JOSIF PANCICA</strong> (Ugrine: 1814 - Belgrade: 1888) <br>

When he decided to take up botany, Pancica never dreamed it would lead him to Serbia, where he would become 
the most renowned botanist and one of the great men of Serbian science. 
He fell in love with nature as a child, and his desire to learn as much of it as possible led him through 
Gospie, Rijeka and Zagreb to Pest, where he studied and gained his PhD at the Medical Faculty. 
Pancica came to Serbia in 1846 and stayed forever. 
In two of his most signiﬁcant works, 
"<em>the Flora of the Principality of Serbia</em>" (1874) and 
"<em>the Supplement to the Flora of the Principality of Serbia</em>" (1884) 
he listed approximately 68% of the currently known species of Serbian ﬂora. 
His most important discovery is the omorica (<em>Picea omorika</em>), an endemite and relict conifer unknown 
to science at the time. 
Although Pancica is the most important Serbian botanist and one of the greatest Serbian scientists,
he was much more than that. 
As a medical doctor who spoke several languages (Latin, German, English, French, Italian, Spanish), 
he was one of the best educated people in Serbia at the time. 
He was the initiator of naturalist thought and sciences in Serbia because he was the ﬁrst to undertake 
complex studies of nature and teach natural sciences and was the professor to the next generation of renowned 
Serbian naturalists.
Pancica wrote natural science textbooks, created professional Serbian language terminology for parts of 
plants, animal organs and geological phenomena, wrote about the need for careful husbandry over natural
resources, wrote the ﬁrst papers on the fauna of Serbia (printed in Serbia), founded the Jestastvenicki 
[natural sciences] Cabinet, its collection becoming the initial fund of the Museum of Natural History, 
and founded the ﬁrst Botanical Garden. 
He was a renowned and respected public personality: the ﬁrst President of the Serbian Royal Academy 
(today the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts), six times the rector of the Great School, 
the ﬁrst manager of the Botanical Garden, vice-president of the National Assembly, state
advisor and Member of Parliament. 
Pancica was dedicated to improving education and the spread of education and culture. 
He fought for peace and brotherhood among the Slavic peoples and as a doctor, participated
in all the liberation wars fought by the Principality of Serbia at the time. 
He achieved all this because throughout his life he kept to the belief that 
“A man with knowledge can be of use to people in many situations, yet ignorance is always harmful 
to all of society.”<br>

				For some reason, Deutsche Post (German Post Authority) almost always add their own label with their
