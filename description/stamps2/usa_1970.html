Issued to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the opening of
the American
Museum of Natural History (AMNH). Its founders included
Theodore Roosevelt, Sr., the father of the 26th U.S. President and
industrialist J.P. Morgan. This
museum - the largest of its kind in the entire world - had
grown to occupy 18 buildings by 1970.By 2010, the museum had
grown to 25 interconnected buildings housing permanent exhibit halls,
research laboratories, and a library. Over 32 million
specimens are now contained in the museum. The 2006 film, Night
at the Museum, was set at the museum.<br>
The Museum boasts habitat dioramas of African, Asian and North
American mammals, a full-size model of a Blue Whale suspended in the
Milstein Family Hall of Ocean Life, sponsored by the family of Paul
Milstein (reopened in 2003), a 62 foot (19 m) Haida carved and painted
war canoe from the Pacific Northwest, a massive 31 ton piece of the
Cape York meteorite, and the Star of India, the largest star sapphire
in the world. The circuit of an entire floor is devoted to vertebrate
evolution. The Museum has extensive anthropological collections: Asian
People, Pacific People, Man in Africa, American Indian collections,
general Native American collections, and collections from Mexico and
Central America.<br>

Although "brontosaurus"
is a better-known name, scientists now refer to this giant,
plant-eating dinosaur as an "apatosaurus" because the name was first
used to identify the beast, and the first name used holds throughout.
They are five-toed, long-necked dinosaurs, who were the dominant
herbivores of their time. Stegosaurus
is a plated dinosaur that had a blimp-like body, long hind legs, short
front legs, and a small head. Its long, heavy tail carried several
pairs of long, bony spikes. The midline of its back had two rows of
unpaired bony plates. Allosaurus
was a large carnivorous dinosaur that had a weight exceeding four tons.
It walked on only two legs, using its long, heavy tail for balance.<br>

<br>
 The stamp is reproduction of a build of
Rudoph Zallinger, as shown on left side.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Zallinger</span> was one of the pioneers of of paleontological
art, perhaps second only to Charles
R. Knight in that respect. Zallinger is best known for his
stunning mural, The
Age of Reptiles, that covers the entire east wall of the Yale
Peabody Museum's Great Hall. The mural depicts the evolution of life on
earth over 300 million years, with different sections, separated by the
visual device of foreground trees, for geologic periods. It was painted
with egg tempera in the fresco secco method; meaning "dry plaster", as
opposed to the more familiar traditional method of painting with into
wet plaster (buon fresco) as practiced by Michelangelo for his frescos
in the Sistine Chapel. <br>

Fossil Halls of the Museum</center>
<br>Most of the Museum's collections of mammalian and
dinosaur fossils remain hidden from public view. They are kept in
numerous storage areas located deep within the Museum complex. Among
these, the most significant storage facility is the ten story Childs Frick
Building which stands within an inner courtyard of the Museum. During
construction of the Frick, giant cranes were employed to lift steel
beams directly from the street, over the roof, and into the courtyard,
in order to ensure that the classic museum facade remained undisturbed.
The predicted great weight of the fossil bones led designers to add
special steel reinforcement to the building's framework, as it now
houses the largest collection of fossil mammals and dinosaurs in the
world. These collections occupy the basement and lower seven floors of
the Frick Building, while the top three floors contain laboratories and
offices. It is inside this particular building that many of the
Museum's intensive research programs into vertebrate paleontology are
carried out.<br>

Of the Nadene linguistic stock, the 13 Tlingit tribes
are a group of North American Indians who formerly occupied the Alaskan
panhandle southward from Yakutat Bay. A population of about 10,000 in
the 1750s dropped to about 4,500 circa 1900. The Tlingits built large
wooden dugout canoes, multi-family plank houses, and wooden storage
boxes and dishes. They also made masks and wove spruce-root baskets.
They frequently had disputes with the Russians. In 1799 the Russians
built a fort on an island in the southeast archipelago, but in 1802 the
Tlingit drove them out.

African elephants are native to parts of southern,
central, and eastern Africa, living in forests, grasslands, river
valleys, and deserts. Its numbers have been reduced by overhunting,
principally for its ivory tusks. Where it is protected, it tends to
overpopulate and defoliate its range, resulting in its own starvation.
The African elephant uses its trunk to strip trees of branches and bark
and even to uproot them. There is a ban on ivory trading. Initiated in
1989, the ban was put into place when the African elephant was declared
endangered by the U.N.'s Convention on International Trade in
Endangered Species.

Haliaeetus leucocephalus, the American bald eagle, is a
rare species that is the national emblem of the United States. Although
protected by law, some large eagles are killed by farmers or captured
for use in falconry. The bald eagle, like other birds, has been
affected by the widespread use of pesticides that can weaken eggs. They
are large, predatory birds that are the symbol of power, courage, and
immortalit
