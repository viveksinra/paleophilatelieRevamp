<br>
On November 9<sup>th</sup>, 1999, the Post Authority of Portugal introduced a new set of vending machine
stamps (ATM) with the title "Dinosaurs of Portugal" (Dinossurios em Portugal). <br>
<br>
Four different designs of dinosaurs and their footprints, were created
by Portuguese artist Jose Projecto, then transferred to stamp-templates (self-adhesive labels)
by the graphic-designer Mariana Santos.
Fossils of all <a href="#dinosaurs">dinosaurs</a> depicted on the stamps as well as their footprints were 
discovered in <a href="../../country/portugal.html">Portugal</a>. <br>

<!-- 
The ATM's were printed by the Ovelar Spanish firm that is known to print the first
Epelsa ATM's for Spain. <br>
-->

<br>
The first ATM machine in Portugal was from the Swiss company FRAMA and was installed on 19 May 1981 in Lisbon.
Since then, Portuguese Post installed ATM machines in many post offices around the country.
In the early 1990s, the  FRAMA machines were gradually withdrawn and replaced by the new distributors: 
German company <span lang="de">Klüssendorf</span> and French company CROUZET. <br>
In 1998, Portuguese Post replace their ATM machines again for the French AMIEL (Amiel Electronique) APM 200
and Portuguese SMD (Sistemas Multiposto e Distribuidos) SIMA 1020.
Both machines used the same type of self-adhesive paper manufactured by Ovelar company in Spain. 
<br>

<!--  
of 60 mm x 34 mm size, 
while the stamps size were 55 mm x 30 mm in size.
-->

<br>
AMIEL machines printed the text in bold and big font, while 
SMD machines used smaller and thin text, as on examples below.<br>

<br>

These dinosaur ATM stamps, with the face values printed in Portuguese Escudo  (PTE) currency , 
marked by "*" before the number and "$" after, were on sale between 09.11.1999 and 22.03.2000, 
but remained valid for postage till 30.09.2001. <br>
<a href="portugal_2000.html">Stamps with double currency</a>: Escudos and Euro were printed 
by AMIEL ATM machines between 21.02.2000 and 31.12.2001, and
by SMD   ATM machines between 13.03.2000 and 31.12.2001. <br>

</table>


Since <a href="portugal_2002.html">01.01.2002</a>, both ATM machines were reprogrammed to 
print stamps with face values in Euro currency only. <br>
The dinosaurs labels were replaced by new designs from both ATM machines on February 28<sup>th</sup>, 2002, 
but remained valid for postage until 2006. <br>
<br>

MICHEL Vending Machines Special stamps catalogue distinguished AMIEL and SMD versions, 
but not the face values. <br>
SMD  stamps have extension ".1", while the AMIEL stamps have extension ".2":  
24.1-27.1 and 24.2-27.2 accordantly. <br>
Scott stamps catalogue does not list any International Vending Machines stamps. <br>


<br>
<a name="esc85"></a>
The ATM machines, in the post offices were programmed for all 7 rates, as in the table below.
<!-- 
Most of the stamps printed at philatelic desk and at the post offices used dot (".") as currency separator. <br>
Stamps sold at  vending machines at some post offices used comma (",") as currency separator - they are very rare. <br>
-->
The rate of domestic letter with weight up to 100g - 
<a href="../../images/details/stamps/official/portugal/1999/portugal_1999_smd_85esc.jpg"><strong><big>Escudo 85</big></strong></a>, 
was missing in the ATM machines installed at the philatelic desk. 
Therefore the stamp with the face value of Escudo 85 from 1999, is difficult to find and 
the "full set" of the dinosaurs ATM stamps from 1999, offered by dealers, usually include 
<a href="../../images/details/stamps/official/portugal/1999/portugal_1999_smd_set_24.jpg">24</a> rather than 
<a href="../../images/details/stamps/official/portugal/1999/portugal_1999_smd_long_set.jpg">28</a> stamps.
The issue was resolved, when the ATM machines were reprogrammed at the beginning of 2000. <br>

<strong>Notes:</strong><br>     
<a name="rate1"></a> [1]
In 1999, the rate of Domestic 20g. letter  was Escudo 51, but the vending machines were programmed for Escudo 50 to prevent 
the Escudo 1 coins from constantly being emptied in the change compartment.
The letters with vending machine stamps of Escudo 50 were accepted by the Post, without any 
extra charge. <br>

<center><h2>Dinosaurs</h2></center>
<em>The following paragraph is a quote of the text 
    published by Portuguese Post in 1999 in their 
	"filatelia novidades" brochure. <br>
</em>
<p>
	Dinosaurs that usually make one's imagination run wild, are amongst the 
	numerous and varied fossils that have remained over the times, becoming the 
	testimonies of the Earth's history. <br>
	They appeared about 235 million years ago and became extinct 65 million years 
	ago, together with many other living species, during an abrupt and amazing 
	great extinction of species which marks the limits between the Cretaceous and 
	the Cainozoic era, this one characterised by the recent forms of life. <br>
	During their long trip around space and time, dinosaurs developed in an 
	amazing way, having reached a great diversity of forms size and way of living 
	and having adapted themselves to all terrestrial environments and to all 
	latitudes. <br>
	Dinosaurs fossils were discovered in the first half of the 19<sup>th</sup> 
	century and immediately occupied the centre of attentions. 
	They became more popular than any other pre-historic animal because of 
	their gigantic and monstrous aspect that characterised the descriptions made at 
	the time of their discovery. 
	The composition of their scientific name itself has stigmatised them: Dinosaur 
	(<em>deinos</em> in Greek means terrible and <em>saur</em> means lizard). <br>
	Dinosaurs "were present" during the oceans expansion, "watched' great 
	volcanic activities and the formation of great mountain ranges, "saw" the first 
	plants with flowers and were testimonies of the first birds flight. 
	They shared the same places with the very reduced and little diversified group of mammals 
	of the time that had to "wait patiently" for the end of the "dinosaurs kingdom" 
	to  finally spread around the world.

The dinosaur stamps were introduced not only in the Lisbon, the capital of Portugal, 
but in several other locations, including <strong>Lourinha</strong>. <br>

<p class="notes">
	Lourinha is a municipality in Portugal with a total area of 147.2 km and a total
	population of 24,601 inhabitants. 
	The seat of the municipality is the town of Lourinha, with a population of 8,800 inhabitants. 
	The municipality is composed of 11 parishes, and is located in the District of Lisbon. 
	The name Lourinha possibly originated in the period of Roman domination, when a villa was located in the area.
</p>

The area of Lourinha is known for Late Jurassic dinosaurs and other fossils. 
The rocks of the area have been assigned to the Lourinha Formation. 
150 million years ago, Western Portugal was a great coastal basin with
plentiful supplies of water and vegetation that made it an ideal habitat for dinosaurs. 
Fossils of all three dinosaurs depicted on the ATM stamps were discovered there.
<br>

<br>
<a name="museum"></a>
<strong>The Museu da Lourinha</strong> (the Museum of Lourinha) holds the main dinosaur collection of the country. 
The museum was founded in 1984 by GEAL - Grupo de Etnologia e Arqueologia da
Lourinha (Lourinha's Group of Ethnology and Archeology). <br>
The museum has very complete exhibits of archaeology and ethnology, but the
main focus of the museum is the <strong>palaeontology</strong> hall, which presents casts of famous 
<a href="#dinosaurs">dinosaurs</a>, as well as fossils recovered from the Late Jurassic Lourinha Formation. <br>

Among these is the famous sauropod nest found at the nearby beach of Paimogo in 1993,
which contains eggs with embryos inside.
The nest with more than 100 eggs, was later assigned to <em>Lourinhanosaurus antunesi</em> 
(<a href="#lourinhanosaurus">depicted on one of the stamps</a>). <br>

In 2011, the Museum issued 
<a href="../../images/sets/personalized/portugal_2011_personalized.jpg">its own personalized stamps</a> 
showing six "domestic" dinosaurs. <br>

The first find in 1957, a partial fossil skeleton found near Alenquer, was
dubbed "<em>Apatosaurus alenquerensis</em>" by Lapparent and Zbyszewski. <br>
However, the find of another partial skeleton, including a tooth and
100 gastroliths, in co-eval strata near the town of Lourinha in 1983,
allowed the identification of the fossils as a distinct form from
<em>Apatosaurus</em>, hence the generic name referring the new locality while
the specific descriptor was carried over from the old designation. <br>

<a name="lourinhasaurus"></a>
<strong><em>Lourinhasaurus</em></strong> (meaning "Lourinh lizard") was a sauropod dinosaur
genus hailing from Late Jurassic strata from two localities in Estremadura, Portugal. 
It was described by Dantas et al. in 1998. 
Its type species is <em>Lourinhasaurus alenquerensis</em>, named for the locality of Alenquer.<br>

<a name="dacentrurus"></a>
<strong><em>Dacentrurus</em></strong> (meaning "tail full of points"), originally known
as <em>Omosaurus</em>, was a large stegosaur of the Late Jurassic
Period (154 - 150 mya) of Europe. <br>
Its type species, <em>Omosaurus armatus</em>, was named in 1875, based on a skeleton found in England. 
In 1902 the genus was renamed  <em>Dacentrurus</em> because the name <em>Omosaurus</em> had already been
used for a crocodilian. <br>
It was a heavily built quadrupedal (walking on four legs) herbivore, adorned with plates and spikes. 
Due to the fact it represented the best known stegosaurian species from Europe, most
stegosaur discoveries in this area are referred to <em>Dacentrurus</em>.   <br>
This included finds in Wiltshire and Dorset in southern England, fossils
from France and Spain and five more historically recent skeletons from Portugal.  <br>
Most of these finds were fragmentary in nature.

<a name="allosaurus"></a>
<strong><em>Allosaurus</em></strong> is a genus of large theropod dinosaur that lived 155 to 150 million years ago 
during the late Jurassic period.  <br>
The first remains that can definitely be ascribed to this genus were described in 1877 
by paleontologist Othniel Charles Marsh. 
As one of the first well-known theropod dinosaurs. <br>
<em>Allosaurus</em> was a large bipedal predator. 
Its skull was large and equipped with dozens of large, sharp teeth. 
It averaged 8.5 m (28 ft) in length. <br>
The bulk of <em>Allosaurus</em> remains have come from North America's Morrison Formation, 
with material also known from 
<a href="../../country/portugal.html">Portugal</a> and possibly 
<a href="../../country/tanzania.html">Tanzania</a>. <br>
<em>Allosaurus</em> appeared on ATM stamp of Portugal once again in <a href="portugal_2015.html">2015</a>. <br>
