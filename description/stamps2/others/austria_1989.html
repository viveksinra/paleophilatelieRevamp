<br>
On 26<sup>th</sup> April, 1989, the Post of Austria, issued the stamp 
"75<sup>th</sup> Commemoration of the Death of Professor Eduard Suess". <br>

The geologist and politician Eduard Suess was born in London on August 20, 1831. 
He was full professor of geology at the University of Vienna and at the same time a
full member of the Vienna Academy of Sciences. 
His first book "Der Boden der Stadt Wien" ("The Soil of Vienna"), which dealt with the
correlation of geologic conditions and water supply, marked the beginning of his increasing scientific 
recognition from that time forward. <br> 
He gradually developed views on the connection between Africa and Europe; eventually he came to the 
conclusion that the Alps to the north were once at the bottom of an ocean, of which the Mediterranean
was a remnant. <br> 
While not quite correct (mostly because plate tectonics had not yet been discovered - he used the earlier 
geosyncline theory), this is close enough to the truth that he is credited with postulating the earlier 
existence of the Tethys Ocean, which he named in 1893. <br>
Suess postulated that as sediments filled the ocean basins the sea levels gradually rose, and periodically 
there were events of rapid ocean bottom subsidence that increased the ocean's capacity and caused
the regressions. 
This became known as the theory of eustasy (eustacy). <br>
His other major theory involved <em>glossopteris</em> fern <strong>fossils</strong> occurring in South America, Africa, 
and <a href="../../../country/india.html">India</a> (as well as Antarctica, though Suess did not know this). 
His explanation was that the three lands were once connected in a supercontinent, which he named 
<strong>Gondwanaland</strong>.

Suess proposed that land bridges would rise out of the oceans to connect land masses together - allowing 
animals to walk across the bridges to spread to other continents (of course this was influenced by the 
early suggestions of the Bering Sea Land Bridge between Eurasia and North America where sea level change 
related to the Pleistocene glaciations allowed bridges to develop). 
Unfortunately, his model was developed before scientists had examined the rock beneath the oceans 
(dense basalt) or had developed models of continental drift. 
He also had no mechanism to explain how the bridges popped up and later dropped down.
Still, it is so similar to what is currently believed that his naming has stuck. <br>



<br>
It is less known, Eduard Suess discovered some dinosaur bones and some <strong>dinosaur</strong> species named after him.
<br>

<!-- 
In 1859 coal mine administrator Pawlowitsch notified the University of Vienna that some fossils 
had been found in the "Gute Hoffnung" mine at Muthmannsdorf in Austria. <br>
-->

In 1859, a young professor Eduard Suess (appointed professor of paleontology at the University of Vienna in 1856) 
 and his student Ferdinand Stoliczka, who became a prominent geologist and paleontologist later on,
  came to explore the "Gute Hoffnung" mine at Muthmannsdorf in Austria. <br>

The team discovered a thin marl layer, intersected by an obliquely sloping mine shaft. 
The marl was a freshwater deposit, now considered part of the <span lang="de">Grünbach</span> Formation. <br>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">
	The Grünbach Formation is an Austrian geological formation that dates to the lower Campanian age of the Late Cretaceous. 
	It forms part of the Gosau Group, and represents a marine regression event, representing a coastal/brackish environment, 
	being underlain by the marine carbonate Maiersdorf Formation and overlain by the deep marine siliciclastic Piesting Formation. 
</p> 

Suess and Stoliczka subsequently uncovered numerous bones of several species, such as 
<em>Megalosaurus</em>, a turtles, crocodiles, dinosaurs and a pterosaur. <br>

All these fossils were stored in the museum of the University of Vienna but received little attention until 1870,
when Austrian paleontologist Emanuel Bunzel came to study them. <br>
<br>

Bunzel published result of his study in the following year in monograph  
"<em>Die Reptilfauna der Gosauformation in der Neuen Welt bei Wiener Neustadt</em>". 
The English translation of the title is "The reptile fauna of the Gosau Formation in the New World near Wiener Neustadt". <br>
<br>
One of the prehistoric animals described by Bunzel is a new genus and species of dinosaur <em>Struthiosaurus austriacus</em>. <br>
<p>
	<strong><em>Struthiosaurus</em></strong> is one of the smallest known and most basal genera of nodosaurid dinosaurs, 
	with estimated length of 2.2 meters only.
	The dinosaur lived in  the Late Cretaceous period (Santonian-Maastrichtian) on the territory
	of  Austria, Romania, France and Hungary. 
</p>

Some other dinosaur bones were assigned by Bunzel to a new species 
<em>Iguanodon suessii</em> (named after Eduard Suess). 
Later on, <em>Iguanodon suessii</em> was reassigned to a new genus <em>Mochlodon</em> and the species renamed to 
<em>Mochlodon suessii</em>. <br>
<p>
	<strong><em>Mochlodon</em></strong> is a genus of iguanodontian ornithopod dinosaurs (<em>Rhabdodontidae</em>) 
	who lived during the Late Cretaceous (85-80 million years ago) on the territory of Austria and Hungary.
</p>

In the summary of his monograph (page 17) Bunzel wrote:
"Of the great interest is therefore not only the occurrence of such diverse forms in a single locality, 
but also the fact that these dinosaur remains are the first to be found in the Austrian empire 
and even in all of Europe in such Late Cretaceous strata."
<br>
<!--
	Von hohem Interesse ist daher nicht nur das Zusammenvorkommenso mannigfacher Formen in einer einzigen Loca-
lität, sondern auch der Umstand, dass diese Dinosaurierreste die ersten sind, welche bisher in der österreichischen
Monarchie ja sogar in ganz Europa in so hohen Kreideschichten angetroffen wurden.
