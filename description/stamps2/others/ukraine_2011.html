<center>PALEONTOLOGICAL MUSEUM OF THE LVIV NATIONAL UNIVERSITY </center>
Paleontological Museum of the Lviv National University was founded in
1852-1853 by the professor of botany G. Lobazhevskyi. Till 1895
geological, geognostic and mineralogical cabinets existed at the Lviv
University.<br>
In 1905 the museum collection was divided, and great part of it was
handed down to the new Geologic-Palaeontological Institute.<br>
Professor Zyber (the first head of the Geologic Department) in 1905
initiated the foundation of Geologic Museum as separate independent
unit. <br>
In 1963 the Geologic Museum moved to the University building on 4,
Hryshvskyi st., where it is situated now.<br>
In February of 2002 the Geological Museum was renamed in
Paleontological Museum. It was done according to the decision of the
Scientific Council of the Faculty of Geology.<br>
The collection of samples of rocks and remnants of fossilized fauna and
flora from different regions of the world, that compose base of the
Paleontological Museum of the Lviv National University, was founded as
far back as the beginning of the 19th century.<br>
L. Tseishner was the first to begin the collection of paleontological
samples in 40s of 19th century. Lomnyzkyi, Semiradskyi and Fridberg
replenished museum funds having contributed new collections during the
second half of the 19th century and at the beginning of the 20th
century. Great contribution to replenishment of the museum collections
made famous polish geologists Pazdro and Kokoshinska. <br>
The museum collections are permanently replenished by unique samples.
Now there are nearly 18 thousands of rare geologic ones (mostly
paleontological), found in different parts of the world (Arctic,
Australia, Asia, Europe, England, Germany and etc.).<br>
Museum exposition allows to show history of Earths geologic development
and evolutional development of organic world. Now museum exposition is
represented by five subdivisions:<img style="border: 0px solid ; width: 275px; height: 206px; float: right;" title="Paleontology museum of Lvov National University" alt="Paleontology museum of Lvov National University" src="../../../images/details/stamps/official_others/ukraine/2011/lvov_museum_foto_01.jpg" hspace="4"><ul class="style4">

<li class="style5">Department of regional geology </li>
<li class="style5">Paleontological subdivision </li>
<li class="style5">Monographic department </li>
<li class="style5">Paleontology Department</li>
</ul>
<br>
In Paleontological Museum a unique exposition of mammoths is placed.
Prettily interesting are samples of the artificial instruments of
primitive peoples found on the territory of Western Ukraine. The most
valuable museums samples are paleontological collection of Mesozoic and
Cenozoic periods found in Western Europe.<br>
Based on the museums materials 40 scientific works were published.
Museum exposition is used by students of geologic, biological and
geographic faculties of Lviv National University. Museum is also
visited by students of other institutes of higher education of Lviv,
Kyiv, Rivne, Drohobych, Lytzk and by visitors from abroad too.<br>
Using museum funds is an integrand part of studying and scientific
work. Fossils of ancient plants and animals, skeletons, the shells
allow to create a life evolution picture on our planet during million
hundreds years. <br>
