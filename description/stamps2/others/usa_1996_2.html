The Smithsonian Institution was established with funds from James
Smithson (1765-1829), a British scientist who left his estate
to the United States to found at Washington, under the name of
the Smithsonian Institution, an establishment for the increase and
diffusion of knowledge.<br>
Smithson, the illegitimate child of a wealthy Englishman, had
traveled much during his life, but had never once set foot on American
soil. Why, then, would he decide to give the entirety of his sizable
estate which totaled half a million dollars, or 1/66 of the United
States entire federal budget at the time to a country that was foreign
to him?<br>

Some speculate it was because he was denied his father's
legacy. Others argue that he was inspired by the United States
experiment with democracy. Some attribute his philanthropy to ideals
inspired by such organizations as the Royal Institution, which was
dedicated to using scientific knowledge to improve human conditions.
Smithson never wrote about or discussed his bequest with friends or
colleagues, so we are left to speculate on the ideals and motivations
of a gift that has had such significant impact on the arts, humanities,
and sciences in the United States.<br>
<br>
Smithson died in 1829, and six years later, President Andrew
Jackson announced the bequest to Congress. On July 1, 1836,
Congress accepted the legacy bequeathed to the nation and pledged the
faith of the United States to the charitable trust. In September 1838,
Smithson's legacy, which amounted to more than 100,000 gold sovereigns,
was delivered to the mint at Philadelphia. Recoined in U.S. currency,
the gift amounted to more than $500,000. <br>
After eight years of sometimes heated debate, an Act of
Congress signed by President James K.
Polk on Aug. 10, 1846, established the Smithsonian
Institution as a trust to be administered by a Board of Regents and a
Secretary of the Smithsonian. Since its founding .more than 164 years
ago, the Smithsonian has become the world's largest museum and research
complex, with 19 museums, the National Zoo and nine research
facilities.<br>

The National Museum of Natural History (NMNH) is part of the Smithsonian
Institution, the world's preeminent museum and research complex.
The Museum is dedicated to inspiring curiosity, discovery, and
learning about the natural world through its unparalleled research,
collections, exhibitions, and education outreach programs. Opened in
1910, the green-domed museum on the National Mall was among the first
Smithsonian building constructed exclusively to house the national
collections and research facilities. The Smithsonian's
<span style="font-weight: bold;">natural history
collections</span> have their origins in the 1838-1842 United
States
Exploring Expedition, which circumnavigated the globe
amassing cultural and natural history collections. Concern over how to
care for the collections led to the provision for a museum as part of
the Smithsonian Institution's enabling act of 1846. In 1858, the US
Congress began to provide appropriations for the United States National
Museum and all the government's collections were transferred to the
Smithsonian Institution. The Smithsonian also received specimens by
gift or purchase in the late 1840s. In 1850, the newly appointed
Assistant Secretary Spencer F. Baird donated his personal natural
history collection to the Institution. During the 1850s and 1860s,
several expeditions which explored the American West, sent additional
specimens to the Institution. The collections were initially housed in
the Institution's first building, the Smithsonian Institution Building,
or Castle, which was completed in 1855.The National
Collections were moved to the newly constructed National Museum
Building, now the Arts and Industries Building, in 1881. But within two
years, the new building was overflowing with collections and
Smithsonian management requested another building from the US Congress.
Legislation for the new building finally passed in 1902, providing for
a granite structure across the National Mall from the Smithsonian
Castle.
