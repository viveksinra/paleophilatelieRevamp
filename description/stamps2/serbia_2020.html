On November 3<sup>rd</sup> 2020, Serbian Post Authority issued a set of 4 stamps
with title "125th anniversary of the Natural History Museum in Belgrade". <br>
<p>
	The Natural History Museum was founded on 19 December, 1895  as Jestastvenički muzej srpske zemlje (Natural Science Museum of Serbian Land)
	and is one of the oldest scientific and cultural institutions in Serbia.
	<br>
	The Natural History Museum has also one of the oldest and richest expert libraries in the Balkans, 
	containing over 27.000 books, manuscripts, scientific periodicals, geographic and geological maps.
	The museum is also the first specialized institution whose three main and inseparable activities are scientific study, 
	protection and presentation of national natural heritage.

	Prior to the foundation of the Museum, in the first half of the 19th century, in the former Principality of Serbia, 
	there was a large number of natural history collections, predominantly kept in the Natural History Cabinet of the Great Lyceum (Great School). 
    <br>
	<strong>Josif Pancic</strong>, who is commemorated on <a href="serbia_2014.html">stamp of Serbia in 2014</a>, 
	is considered to be the founder of the Natural History Museum who, accompanied by  his associates and students, 
	systematically collected, studied and extracted specimens from nature to be exhibited. <br>
	Thoroughly investigating the flora of Serbia during his era, he discovered and described about 50, scientifically valid, plant species.
	He was the first president of the Serbian Royal Academy and the Great Lyceum professor and became the first manager of the Museum.<br>
	The first exhibition of the Museum was held in 1904 in Belgrade, in the presence of King Peter I and his officials.
	<br>
	<br>
	Nowadays, the Museum has 120 collections containing more than 2 million objects, which
	ranks the Museum amongst the leading Natural History Museums of South-East Europe.

	These collections span the history of the Earth from 4.5 billion years ago to the present, ranging 	from meteorites 
	from the time of formation of the solar system, hundreds of millions of years old fossils, 
	to specimens of Serbian spruce and flower <em>Ramonda 	serbica</em> (discovered and described by Josif Pancic)
    as well as a lot of unique HOLOTYPES — type specimens by which newly discovered species were 
	described for the first time. 
    <br>
	 The museum is the only one of its kind in Serbia, however even today the museum does not have permanent exhibits.  
	 Instead a variety of activities including temporary exhibits, promotions, presentations and conferences are 
	 organized at the museum’s secondary site, the Gallery at Kalemegdan.
	 Due to the fact that the area of the gallery is only about 200m<sup>2</sup>
	  (much to small to show even a fraction of all of the significant objects in their collection),
	 the Museum prepares and mounts 3 to 4 temporary exhibitions a year.
	 <br>	 
	 Many Serbian scientists wish to have a bigger, more modern building, 
	 which is actually constructed for the purpose of being a museum with ample space for both 
	 permanent and temporary exhibits and more space for storage of the collections. 
	 <br> 
	 <br>
	 Nevertheless the lack of space, the Museum is very active in Serbia.
     <br>
	 The Museum’s staff participate in local and international  conferences and seminars, maintain a prolific production and publication of scientific papers
	 in periodicals, and are often involved in projects in the country and abroad.<br>
	 The Museum cooperates with other museums in Serbia and abroad, governmental and nongovernmental organizations, and various faculties of the University and the Serbian
	 Academy of Sciences and Arts. 
	 <br>
	 In 2009, as result of cooperation between the Natural History Museum  and GGPCLA Grupo Cultural from Argentina, 
	 Serbian people were able to see many of Argentinian Dinosaurs in the Impulse hall of the hotel "Continental" in Belgrade.<br>
	 The exhibition "<strong>Dinosaurs of Argentina - Giants of Patagonia</strong>", 
	 which includes original skeletons and reconstruction of many dinosaurs and other Mesozoic reptiles.
	 It was a very significant culture event in Serbia in 2009 and attracted many visitors.

	 The Museum maintains fruitful cooperation with the media, involved in the filming
	 of specialized TV programs and films, participates in the preparation of TV and radio
	 contributions and newspaper articles, and prepares media releases, 
	 as well as supports publishing houses that produce specialized editions and monographs.

<big>One of the stamps from "125th anniversary of the Natural History Museum in Belgrade" set shows a fossil

	<strong>EXTINCT CROOKED HORNED ANTELOPE</strong> (<em>Hypsodontus serbicus</em>)<br> 
	During a 1969 excavation in Prebreza, experts from the Natural History Museum found
	a fossilized skull of a hitherto unknown representative of early bovids,
	 species of extinct <em>Hypsodontus</em> genus.<br>
	 To show its significance to Serbian science, it was named <em>Hypsodontus <strong>serbicus</strong></em>.

	<br>
	<a href="../../images/details/stamps/official/serbia/2020/serbia_2020_2.jpg">
		<img align="right" hspace="6" 
		   alt="EXTlNCT CROOKED HORNED ANTELOPE Hypsodontus serbicus on stamp of Serbia 2020" 
		   title="EXTlNCT CROOKED HORNED ANTELOPE Hypsodontus serbicus on stamp of Serbia 2020"
		   src="../../images/details/stamps/official/serbia/2020/preview/serbia_2020_2.jpg">
		   </a>
	<br> 
	The paleontological site of <strong>Prebreza</strong> in southern Serbia is an important 
	European mammalian site of Middle Miocene age  (about 15 - 12 million years ago). 
	The presence of various species shows the migration routes of various taxa in an 
	intercontinental exchange that occurred between Europe, Asia and Africa.
	<br><br>
	<em>Hypsodontus serbicus</em> is the only known representative of the group west of Belomechetskaia,
	  <a href="../../country/georgia.html">Georgia</a>, while this genus has an Asian origin, and may have been present in Arabia as well.
	<br>
	<em>Hypsodontus</em> was a medium, slender, long-legged bovid with estimated weight of about 110kg with 
	relatively short but curved and twisted outward horns.<br>
	The shape of the body must have resembled that of some current antelopes, and the legs were particularly elongated.<br>
	<em>Hypsodontus</em>'s long legs indicate that this animal was well adapted to an open environment, and was likely a good runner. 
	The high-crowned teeth indicate that <em>Hypsodontus</em> was able to feed on grass and other particularly tough and fibrous plants, 
	in a way very similar to that of today's horses.</p>

<br>
<br>
<big>The other three stamps of the set show the domestic plant (RTANJSKA METVICA),
	 mineral (JARANDOLITE MINERAL) and the recently extinct animal (The BEAR OF JASTREBAC MOUNTAIN).</big>

				<strong>RTANJSKA METVICA</strong>  (<em>Nepeta rtanjensis</em>)<br>
				On the basis of the specimens found by Bojana Milojevié in 
				1974, this species was determined as a new one for science by Nikola Diklié, the 
				curator of the Natural History Museum. This discovery is exceptional, the plant is 
				endemic and of a relict character, it grows only on the mountain Rtanj. 
				The species was named for specimens described at the Natural History Museum and are stored in the Museum’s botanical collections.			
			</td>
			<td width="34%">
				<strong>JARANDOLITE MINERAL</strong><br>
				The mineral was found by geologist Dobrica Stojanovié in the vicinity 
				of Baljevac on the Ibar and described in 1992. He donated a few samples to the 
				Natural History Museum. He suggested the name srbijanit, which was not 
				accepted. A Russian team which did some research in the same area proposed 
				the name jarandolite for the newly discovered mineral, which was officially 
				adopted in 2004. It belongs to the group of rare boron minerals.			
			</td>
			<td width="33%">
				<strong>THE LAST BEAR OF JASTREBAC MOUNTAIN</strong> (<em>Ursus arctos</em>)<br>  was shot in 1885 by King 
				Milan I Obrenovié. The taxidermic preparation was done by the Viennese 
				imperial preparator Eduard Hodek. It was placed in the hall of the Old Palace of 
				the dynasty and was a silent witness of the May Coup. It has been preserved 
				thanks to Queen Natalija and was exhibited in the Museum of Forestry and 
				Hunting. Today it is kept in the Natural History Museum. 
				The last bear of Jastrebac Mountain represents an exceptionally important example of Serbian cultural heritage.
