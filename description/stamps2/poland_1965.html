<br>
On March 5<sup>th</sup>, 1965, the Postal Authority of Poland issued the set 
of 10 stamps  "Prehistoric animals", to popularize discoveries of 
the national paleontologists. 
These are <a href="../../milestones.html#dino_set">the first pictorial stamps 
depicting prehistoric animals</a>. <br>

<br>
The stamps were designed by the artist Andrzej Heindrich based on pictures of 
Zdenek Burian, who was a Czech painter and book illustrator, whose work during a 
remarkable career spanning five decades, played a central role in the development of 
paleontological reconstructions.<br>
Originally only recognized in his native Czechoslovakia, Burian’s fame later spread 
to an international audience, and a number of artists attempted to emulate his style.
Burian is regarded by many as the most influential paleo-artist of the modern era. 
Many stamps issued around the world are based on his illustrations. <br>


<br>
<em>The text below is a quote from "Filatelista" magazine, published in 1965.
	According to recent knowledge some statements, as well as 
	reconstruction of prehistoric animals, such as <em>Brachiosaurus</em> 
	staying almost fully under water, are obsolete. </em><br>
<br>

Paleontology is a science which due to its research of fossils and prints on them
introduces us in the fascinating and mysterious world of the
prehistorical flora and fauna. 
The Polish Post having in mind the popularization of the results and discoveries of the paleontologists 
issued in March 1965 the set of 10 stamps "Prehistorical Animals". <br>

The 20 gr stamp depicts a reptile <strong><em>Edaphosaurus</em></strong>
living in the Permian--Carboniferous period.<br>

<br>
The 40 gr stamp acquaints on us with one of the most popular and well known of the dinosaurs, 
the  <strong><em>Brontosaurus</em></strong> (is now known as <em>Apatosaurus</em>). <br>
It lived on the marshes of North America in the Jurassic period some 150 million years ago. 
It fed on plants.  <br>
Its body was 18 meter long, weighed 20 ton, period of growing up was 200 years.  <br>
It was like all vegetable-feeding giants, flegmatic and meek.  <br>
Having no armour and being feebly teethed, it had as only rescue against 
the rapacious reptiles the flight in the water. <br>

The carnivorous plesiosaur <strong><em>Cryptoclidus</em></strong> 
[misspelled Cryptocl<u>ei</u>dus], 
represented on the 30 gr stamp lived fishing in the ocean in the Mesozoic Era. <br>
Its body was flat, 5 meter long, covered with a smooth skin.  <br>
It had four fin-like extremities and a short tail, used as a rudder.  <br>
A small head with a pair of strong jaws placed on a long and versatile neck 
facilitated gaining of food.<br>

<br>
<strong><em>Mesosaurus</em></strong> represented on the 60 gr stamp lived in the Permian 
Period in the ocean of the southern hemisphere.  <br>
Its body was not longer than 70 cm.  <br>
It had a long beak-like mouth with a real collection of needle sharp teeth.  <br>
Owing to the long shape of its body, long tail and four paws with 5 fingers 
joined by a fin-like membrane it was a marvellous swimmer and a real dread 
for fishes, which were its food. <br>

On the 90 gr stamp we will find the Jurassic <strong><em>Stegosaurus</em></strong>.  <br>
With its strong armour it is like a real tank among fossil reptiles.  <br>
It lived in North America, feeding itself on plants. 
It was not dangerous.  <br>
Its 9 meter long body moved with difficulty on two pair of paws.  <br>
The short neck did not permit to reach for food placed in higher places.  
It was sheltered against the danger with an armour, and had for its defence a
strong tail with prickles. <br>
<br>

<strong><em>Styracosaurus</em></strong> represented on the 1.35 zl stamp is a dinosaur
very similar in exterior appearance to the present rhinoceros. <br>
It lived in the Cretaceous Period in North America.  <br>
Its powerful head and neck were covered with an armour and several big horns, 
one of them fixed on the nose of the animal was 50 cm long.  
In the fight it was not be beaten. <br>

The 1.15 zl stamp represents <strong><em>Brachiosaurus</em></strong>,
living 	on the breach of the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods in the waters of
America and North Africa.  <br>
This reptile with a small head and long neck had a powerful body on four strong 
legs and a very strong tail. <br>
Measurements of the body: 
from head to tail 22 meter, neck 9 meters, height 12 meters. <br>
It lived on the land as well as under the water. <br>
<br>

<strong><em>Corythosaurus</em></strong> represented on the 3.40 zl stamp is a
dinosaur looking like a kangaroo.  <br>
The 10 m long body moved on a strongly developed pair of hinder legs and a long tail. 
The front legs were very weak.  <br>
It lived in the Cretaceous Period on territories rich in water and plants, 
probably across the entire globe. <br>

<strong><em>Rhamphorhynchus</em></strong> represented on the 5.60 zl stamp lived in the 
Jurassic Period.  <br>
The skeleton of this strange flying reptile was found in the Jurassic beds 
in Bavaria (Germany) and some remnants in Africa.  <br>
The span of the "wings" was 80 cm. 
The long beak-mouth was strongly teethed. 
Fishes and insects were its food.  <br>
A specific characteristic of this animal was its long tail facilitating steerage
in plunging and flying.  <br>
<br>

The last stamp of the set for 6.50 zl represents a predaceous <strong><em>Tyrannosaurus</em></strong>,
14 m long and 5 m tall, living in the Cretaceous Period.  <br>
Its mouth 1 m long with powerful jaws and sharp strong teeth are the best proof 
of its carnivorous mode of life.  <br>
Its strong hind legs and a long tail supported the big heavy body of the monster.  <br>
The pair of undeveloped front legs was without significance. <br>
It hunted even the biggest dinosaurs. <br>

<strong>Colour shift.</strong> <br>
<br>
These stamps were produced in the millions using the offset printing technique. 
Offset printing uses separate plates for each colour. 
If the sheets move slightly between impressions, or if the cylinders are not perfectly aligned, 
the colours will not register correctly and may not land precisely on top of each other. <br>

In many cases, colour shifts are minor and can only be observed with a 
<a href="../../articles/how_to_start.html#magnifying_glass">magnifying glass</a>
