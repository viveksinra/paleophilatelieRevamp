The team was excited to design the stamp and coin sets of prehistoric reptiles, as it provided an 
opportunity to bring to physical products a sense of engagement  typically found in walk-through 
exhibitions. <br>
The stamp presentation pack includes a map that shows the migration of prehistoric reptiles across 
the ancient supercontinent of Gondwana. 
It includes background information about the reptiles and even a couple of surprises.
The coin case is beautifully crafted leather, designed to represent the adventurer’s journal. <br>
Graphic design was created by "the Alchemist", the coin cases by Izzat Design, and illustrations 
and writing by Eric Dorfman. 
Paleontological assistance was provided by geologist and paleontologist Dr. Hamish Campbell 
from GNS Sciences, New Zealand. 

"Ancient Reptiles of New Zealand" explores the Cretaceous landscape, 70 million years ago, as if somebody 
were able to travel back in time and observe it directly. 
Illustrations on the stamps and coins were "field sketches" – reconstructions based on the most 
up-to-date information on animal behaviour, ecology and New Zealand palaeontology.
Although there is an element of fantasy to the presentation, the facts reflect the most current scientific 
thinking. <br>
The colourful three-panel presentation pack contain in-depth information, created in the style of a field 
researcher’s notebook and accompanied by five gummed stamps, a miniature sheet, a set of stickers, 
a first day cover (FDC) and an A2 map tracing the giant reptiles migration over the ancient super-continent 
of Gondwana. <br>

<br>
The prehistoric animals depicted in this series include two dinosaurs: a theropod [<em>Allosaurus</em>) 
and a sauropod (<em>Titanosaurus</em>): two marine reptiles: a mosasaur (<em>Moanasaurus</em>) and an elasmosaur
(<em>Mauisaurus</em>); and a flying reptile or pterosaur named <em>Anhanguera</em>. <br>

These are very fine representations of these animals and they are based on substantive research by many palaeontologists 
over many years, but mainly on fossil discoveries in continental North America, South America, Africa, Europe and Asia. <br>
<br>
The fossil remains of large animals have always fascinated mankind, and they can be found globally wherever 
there are suitable sedimentary rock formations. 
In this regard, New Zealand is no exception. 
A hundred million years ago, New Zealand's land formed the eastern margin of the southern super-continent 
of Gondwana. 
Separated by an ocean, "Zealandia" had its own group of dinosaurs, pterosaurs (flying reptiles) and giant marine reptiles 
that thrived here for 20 million years. <br>

The New Zealand fossils to which these animals relate are fairly limited. 
For instance, our knowledge of the two dinosaurs <em>Allosaurus</em> and <em>Titanosaurus</em> is based 
on single bone fossils. 
They are both vertebrae (back bones) yet they are so distinctive that we can be quite certain of their 
identity. 
Similarly, only a few bones are known for the pterosaur, identified here as <em>Anhanguera</em>. <br>
Finding only individual bones of fragments from these animals makes it hard to identify them down to species level.
A great deal more fossils are known for the marine reptiles, the short-necked
<em>Moanasaurus</em> and the long-necked <em>Mauisaurus</em>. 
And there is a good reason for this: most of the Mesozoic sedimentary rocks of New Zealand are marine. 
Dinosaurs were strictly terrestrial animals and terrestrial rocks of the right age are surprisingly rare in New Zealand. <br>

<br>
Conspicuous fossil bones and teeth exposed in and/or on natural rock surfaces have always been observed in 
various places around New Zealand. 
However, professional geologists were the first to collect Mesozoic fossil reptiles in New Zealand 
for scientific study and have done so since the 1850s. 
There is a national inventory of all known fossil localities in New Zealand and it includes all 
localities of Mesozoic reptile fossils. 
This the 'New Zealand Fossil Record File', administered by the Geological Society of New Zealand and 
GNS Science. 
GNS also maintains the National Paleontological Collections, and it is here that most collections 
of Mesozoic reptile fossils from New Zealand are kept, with smaller repositories held at 
regional museums and university collections. <br>

The five representative Mesozoic reptiles depicted on the stamps serve as an unintentional but 
fitting tribute to the achievements of palaeontologist <a href="new_zealand_2022.html">Joan Wiffen</a> 
(1922-2008), who was shown on a <a href="new_zealand_2022.html">stamp in 2022</a>.
Remarkably, she and her colleagues in the Hawke's Bay Palaeontology Group
(a small club formed in the early 1970's by Joan and her husband Pont) have discovered fossils of 
all five of these animals at one locality in a sandstone formation of Late Cretaceous age, 
about 75 million years old.

Specifically, their collections have all been from the Mangahouanga Stream,
a tributary of the Te Hoe River, inland Hawke's Bay, North Island.  
The locality is remote, hard to get to and on private land. <br>

<br>
In the family’s search through geological survey maps trying to find likely places to search 
for fossils, Joan found a reference to rocks that contained ‘reptilian remains’ in a 
remote part of inland Hawke’s Bay. 

This comment can be attributed to observations made by Don Haw, a professional oil exploration 
geologist employed by British Petroleum (BP), who surveyed the Te Hoe Valley in the late 1950s 
and prepared a detailed report of his findings, including the discovery of fossil bones in 
Mangahouanga Stream.
Associated fossil shells confirmed that the bone-bearing rock formation was a marine sandstone of 
Late Cretaceous age.  <br>
However, nobody followed this up at the time, stimulating Joan Wiffen to further 
search the area. <br>

It took six months to get information on the locality and then to get permission from the landowner 
to visit. 
On Saturday 2<sup>nd</sup> December 1972 the Wiffens made their first visit to Mangahouanga Stream, 
which flows through steep, forest-covered hills of the Maungataniwha area of inland Hawke’s Bay. <br>

The 'Maungataniwha' name, suggests that local Māori were aware of the fossil bones and attributed 
them to some unknown monster or 'taniwha'. <br>

Collecting and transporting the fossils was hard, physical work.
Access was by foot only, the terrain was extremely steep and rugged, and every rock they wanted to 
study at home had to be carried to the car on their backs.  <br>
After several months searching, they found their first fossil bone from a marine reptile. 
This was the beginning of many discoveries of other marine reptile fossils. 
During the next few years, the team collected many marine reptile fossils and 
even the very first dinosaur fossil from New Zealand! <br>

Most of the fossil bones and teeth discovered by Joan Wiffen and her colleagues are housed within the 
National Palaeontological Collections held by GNS Science, Lower Hutt. 
Some are on loan to the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa (Te Papa) for display in 
Wellington, including the first dinosaur fossil ever found in New Zealand: 
a theropod tail vertebra.  <br>

<p>
	Also housed at the Te Papa in Wellington is a remarkable dinosaur fossil 
	from Sussex, England. 
	It is a fossil tooth that is considered to be the very first fossil to be recognised as a 'dinosaur'. 
	Its finding in a quarry near Cuckfield in 1820 is attributed to Mary-Anne Mantell, wife of 
	palaeontologist Gideon Mantell.
	Gideon Mantell formally described his wife's famous fossil in 1822 and named it 'Iguanodon'.  <br>
	It is housed in New Zealand because his son Walter built a career in the early colonial days of New 
	Zealand (1840s to 1880s) and was a key figure in the development of the Colonial Museum (now Te Papa). 
	He inherited his father's belongings in the 1850s, including the Iguanodon tooth.

<h2>Prehistoric animals of the stamps</h2>
<u>Note</u>: A large part of the following text was copied from the booklet included into 
the Limited Edition Pack. The text for the booklet was written by 
renowned New Zealand geologist and palaeontologist Dr. Hamish Campbell from 
GNS Sciences.<br>
<br>
<a name="allosaurus"></a>  
50c - <strong><em>Allosaurus</em></strong><br>

At 12 metres long, <em>Allosaurus</em> was the largest meat eater on land in the region. 
It was at the top of the food chain and, it has been suggested, had a cooperative 
social behaviour, hunting in packs, much like lions do today. 
The dinosaur was able to open its jaws extremely widely, allowing it to attack large prey. <br>

<br>
The bulk of Allosaurus remains have come from North America's Morrison Formation, 
with material also known from Portugal (<em>Allosaurus europaeus</em> - appeared on several 
<a href="../../country/portugal.html">stamps of Portugal</a>). <br>
A life-sized replica <em>Allosaurus</em> skeleton can be seen in Canterbury Museum, Christchurch, New Zealand. <br>
At the time of the stamp issue, only a single bone of <em>Allosaurus</em> was known from New Zealand.
<br>

<br>
In 1975, Joan Wiffen and her husband Pont discovered an unusual bone from the Mangahouanga Valley in Northern Hawkes Bay.
It was small but clearly a backbone (vertebra).
She puzzled over its identity for some years. 
Eventually she had it examined by vertebrate palaeontologist Dr. Ralph Molnar at Queensland Museum 
(Brisbane, <a href="../../country/australia.html">Australia</a>), 
who identified it as a tail bone of a carnivorous theropod dinosaur (<em>Theropoda indet.</em>).

<p class="notes">
	It was the second dinosaur bone discovered in New Zealand.
	In 1974 Joan Wiffen extracted (using acid extraction) a therapod toe bone from a rock brought to her by a friend, Bill, who found it

In February 1980, Wiffen and Molnar announced their findings at the 'Fifth International Gondwana Symposium' held in Wellington.
It was a remarkable publication that rewrote the textbooks of New Zealand's natural history. 
Before then, there were no descriptions of  dinosaurs who lived in the country.  
Most people believed that New Zealand had never had dinosaurs as the country had been isolated from other 
lands for so long that it did not seem likely. <br>
<br>
According to our knowledge today, during Mesozoic time, New Zealand  was just part of 
continental eastern Gondwana and it was fairly close to the South Pole. 
Then about 83 million years ago, in Late Cretaceous time, the continent Zealandia, was rifted away 
and moved to the northeast with the formation of the Tasman Sea. 
Zealandia carried a cargo of Gondwanan plants and animals, including dinosaurs and pterosaurs. <br>

$1.00 - <strong><em>Anhanguera</em></strong><br>
This pterosaur was the most common flying reptile in Zealandia. 
Fish eaters with a five-metre wingspan, they formed large coastal nesting
colonies, similar to the seabirds of our time. 
They laid leathery eggs, and the flight centres in the brains of the young developed 
well before hatching, suggesting that they could fly from birth. <br>

A small number of pterosaur fossils have been recorded from New Zealand in Late Cretaceous rocks at 
Mangahouanga Stream and also the Waipara area in north Canterbury. 
Pterosaur bones are distinctive and easily recognised, but determining their more specific identity 
(genus and species) is not so easy when there are only a few fragmental and/or incomplete bone and teeth 
fossils available. <br> 
<br>
No pterosaur skulls or skeletons have been found in New Zealand, and the best preserved fossils 
are from Mangahouanga Stream. 
They include relatively complete bones and some isolated teeth that were discovered, 
collected, prepared and described by Joan Wiffen and her team. <br>
One of the best preserved pterosaur fossils is a shoulder bone (scapula). 
This bone is most similar to the scapula of a pterosaur described from Cretaceous rocks in 
<a href="../../country/brazil.html">Brazil</a> named <em>Anhanguera</em> 
(after a village with the same name meaning 'little devil' in Portuguese). <br>

<em>Titanosaurus</em> was the last descendant of the giant sauropods. 
It was small for a member of this group of dinosaurs, just 14 metres long, but
was still massive and weighed about 13 tonnes. <br>
 
It was tall enough to browse the treetops and large ferns, travelling as part of an extensive
herd to protect itself from predators.<br>

<em>Titanosaurus</em>, literally meaning 'titanic lizard', was named after the mythological Titans.
It was the first Indian dinosaur to be named and properly described, having been 
recorded for the first time in 1877. <br>

Titanosaurid fossils are cosmopolitan in that they are known from all continents 
(but not Antarctica as yet) including Zealandia, the New Zealand continent. 
They were also diverse. 
At least 40 different genera of dinosaur are attributed to the titanosaurids and more than 75 species. 
They were the dominant sauropods during Late Cretaceous time, 90-65 million years ago.  <br>
<br>
A single fossil, an incomplete back bone (vertebra), was recovered by Joan Wiffen from the Mangahouanga 
Stream locality in the 1990s. 
She and vertebrate palaeontologist Dr, Ralph Molnar formally described this fossil in 2008, less than a 
year before her death at age 87. <br>
The fossil is so distinctive in terms of its size and shape that it can be confidently assigned 
titanosaurid, but more information is necessary to make a more specific determination of 
the genus or species to which this bone belongs. 
It relates to an animal that was about eight metres in length. <br>

$2.30 - <strong><em>Moanasaurus</em></strong><br>
The mosasaurs (including <em>Moanasaurus</em>) were the top predators of the shallow coasts of Zealandia. 
At 12 metres long, with a 78-centimetre long skull, <em>Moanasaurus</em> would have been a fearsome
predator, undulating its body through the water a little like a crocodile with paddled feet. 
Although mosasaurs were widespread across the world, <em>Moanasaurus</em> was specific to this region. 
They were strictly aquatic and they would have been air-breathing. 
Like modern marine mammals, they would have had to surface in order to breathe. <br>

Mosasaur fossils were first discovered in New Zealand in 1869. 
Since then, a significant number of fossil bones attributable to mosasaurs have been found in rocks of 
Late Cretaceous age, many by the early New Zealand geologists and most notably Julius von Haast, 
Alexander McKay and Sir James Hector. <br>
The main fossil localities are at Mangahouanga Stream (Hawke's Bay), Haumuri Bluff, Conway River, 
Waipara (Canterbury) and Shag Point (Otago). <br>

In 1874,  James Hector who was Director of the Geological Survey of New Zealand, 
wrote in "On the Fossil Reptilia of New Zealand": <br>

"The first notice of the occurrence in New Zealand strata of representatives of the Reptilian fauna 
characteristic of the mesozoic epoch, was made in 1861, when Professor Owen communicated to the 
British Association a brief description of certain fossils that had been discovered by Mr. T. H. Cockburn
Hood, P.G.S., and presented by him to the British Museum. 
These fossil remains were obtained by Mr. Hood in a ravine on one of the tributaries of the Waipara River, 
at the northern extremity of the Canterbury plains. 
They comprise the vertebral centra, ribs, and coracoid bones, all belonging to the same individual which 
Professor Owen referred to a new species — <em>Plesiosaurus australis</em>. <br>

No further discovery of Saurian remains was made till after the occurrence of a great flood, in 1868,
 when Mr. Hood again obtained a large collection, and shipped it to England, unfortunately, by the 
 ship "Mataoka" which was lost on the homeward voyage. Dr. Haast, however, communicated a short account
of this collection to the Philosophical Institute of Canterbury, and states that he  <br>

"made drawings and took measurements of all the more important
specimens, so that, in case the collection should not reach its destination, the
information, at least, will not be altogether lost to the scientific world." <br>
This foresight was most fortunate, as, notwithstanding the great number and variety
of the remains since found, that collection appears to have contained the only
skull fragment, with jaws and teeth, of a true <em>Sauropterygian</em> that has yet
been discovered. <br>

In 1867 I had visited the locality along with Mr. W. T. L. Travers, and obtained only a few fragments 
of these fossils; but after Mr. Hood's second discovery I sent Mr. R. L. Holmes, provided with the 
requisite appliances, to obtain a more complete collection for the Colonial Museum. 
Drawings of these, forwarded to Professor Owen, enabled him to add two new species, which he named 
<em>Plesiosaurus crassicostatus</em> and <em>Plesiosaurus hoodii</em>.
In the following year Dr. Haast made a detailed survey of the district, and
obtained a large series of Saurian and other fossils, which are now in the
Canterbury Museum..." <br>

Mosasaur fossils tend to be large as they relate to animals that were up to eight metres in length, and 
therefore preserve well, but they are very difficult  to extract from solid rock. 
To do so is labour intensive and requires much skill and care. 
Nevertheless, over the years several relatively complete skeletons have been excavated and prepared, 
particularly at Canterbury Museum, Christchurch. 
But the most spectacular fossils are of skulls. <br>

One of these found by Joan Wiffen and her colleagues in Mangahouanga Stream, inland Hawke's Bay, is on 
display at Te Papa in Wellington. 
It is considered to be one of the finest mosasaur specimens known globally. 
Mosasaurs have a markedly different skull structure and limbs that project from the sides of their bodies, 
not beneath. 
In terms of their skeletal structure and also the nature of their teeth, mosasaurs may be thought of as 
giant swimming lizards. 
<br>

All known mosasaur fossils in New Zealand are from sedimentary formations that originally accumulated as 
sand and silt on the sea floor. 
They are commonly associated with other fossils, mainly shellfish (molluscs) including ammonites and 
belemnites, and plankton (microfossils). 
At least six species of mosasaur have been described from New Zealand with genus names such as 
<em>Prognathodon, Moanasaurus, Rikisaurus, Taniwhasaurus</em> and <em>Mosasaurus</em>. 
(The skull of the <em>Prognathodon overtoni</em> is shown on the background of 
<a href="../../images/details/stamps/official/new_zealand/2022/preview/new_zealand_2022_Joan_Wiffen.jpg">Joan

Some of these colourful names are distinctly New Zealand. <br>

This meant that, for all its size, its diet was restricted to small fish and squid in 
the shallow coastal waters in which it lived. <br>
Their fossils have been found in marine sedimentary rocks (mainly sandstone and 
siltstone) of Late Cretaceous age, between 100 and 65 million years ago, all over the world. <br>
<br>
A well preserved elasmosaur skull is part of the National Paleontological Collection at GNS Science.. 
This superb specimen was discovered by Joan Wiffen and her colleagues at Mangahouanga Stream, Te Hoe Valley, 
Hawke's Bay. <br>
It was subsequently prepared and described by Joan Wiffen and vertebrate palaeontologist Dr Ralph Molnar, 
and formally named <em>Tuarangisaurus keyesi</em>. <br>
The genus name relates to its New Zealand origins and means 'lizard from Tuarangi'. 
The species name honours Ian Keyes, a skilled fossil preparator, palaeontologist and curator with 
New Zealand Geological Survey, and a significant mentor to Joan Wiffen. <br>
As with all other fossils at this locality, it is derived from the Maungataniwha Sandstone. <br>
<br>
<em>Elasmosaurs</em> bones are the most common vertebrate fossils that have been found 
at the Mangahouanga Stream locality, but as with mosasaur fossils, they are known from 
a number of other localities of Late Cretaceous age from elsewhere in New Zealand, 
especially at north Canterbury and Shag Point (Otago).<br>
Thus far, three elasmosaur genera have been discovered from New Zealand, all with 
distinctive New Zealand names. 
They include <em>Tuarangisaurus</em>, <em>Mauisaurus</em> and <em>Kaiwhekea</em>. <br>
The almost complete skeleton of Kaiwhekea from Shag Point was collected, prepared and described by 
Professor Ewan Fordyce and colleagues, and is on display at Otago Museum, Dunedin. <br>
Since 2000, a more 'precise' age for the Maungataniwha Sandstone has been established on the basis of 
microfossils. 
The age is 75 million years, plus or minus one or two million. 
This is based on the presence of very distinctive microscopic dinoflagellates, which are a group of marine 
algae. 
These fossils look like geometric armour-plated capsules (they are reproductive vessels) with tassels at 
each corner, and are so tough that they can be extracted from hard rock using powerful acids.
