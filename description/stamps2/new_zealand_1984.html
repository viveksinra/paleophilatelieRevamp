On February 1<sup>st</sup>, 1984, the Post Authority of New Zealand, 
on occasion of the 50<sup>th</sup> jubilee of the New Zealand Antarctic Society,
issued the set of 4 stamps "New Zealand involvement in Antarctica". <br>

<br>
<em>The following text is based on the press release of the New Zealand's Post, published on their website and 
  Philatelic Bulletin No. 30 from October 1983. 
  The text about the discovery of the plant fossils in Antarctica was added by 
  <a href="../../about.html">author of this website</a>.
</em>
<br>

<br>
These stamps were designed by Maurice Conly of Waikanae, the
official artist for the Antarctic Division of the Department of Scientific and
Industrial Research and were issued in individual sheets of 100 and a Mini-Sheet of all 4. <br>
<br>
The Mini-Sheet shows a RNZAF Hercules transport aircraft on the Williams Field which is the "airport"
for everyone arriving on the ice. 
Also featured are the Scott Base huskies, the original form of transportation in
the Antarctic, and now quite a tourist attraction according to Mr. Conly who
has visited the area several times. <br>


<br>
In the last 100 years, 'Terra Australis Incognita', the 'Hidden Southern Land', has been slowly unveiling its secrets 
after spending a lifetime in forbidding silence. 
Its 14 million square kilometres of ice and snow is described as being the driest, coldest and 
windiest place in the world. 
Yet, undeniably, this cruel continent commands an air of awesome significance and supreme beauty. <br>

On the southern most tip of <a href="../../country/ross.html">Ross Island,</a> 
located on the edge of the Ross Ice Shelf on the Antarctic continent, is Scott Base, established in 1957 
to support New Zealand's participation in the International Geophysical Year scientific research programme.
Since then, it has been continuously occupied by scientists and support staff.  <br>
Today, up to 300 New Zealanders are involved in Antarctica during the summer season, conducting scientific
studies at Scott Base and in more remote areas of the Dependency, and providing vital support facilities.
During winter up to 12 staff members stay at Scott Base to sustain important continuous scientific observations. <br>

<p class="notes">
  Today, most of New Zealand's Antarctic involvement is in the Ross
  Dependency, named after James Clark Ross, who led a British expedition from 1839-43 which
  penetrated the Ross Sea and discovered the Ross Ice Shelf, McMurdo Sound and Ross Island.
  The two main peaks of Ross Island are named after his ships "Erebus" and "Terror".  <br>
  <br>  
  Britain claimed the Ross Sea area in 1887, and in 1923 placed the region under the jurisdiction 
  of the Governor-General of New Zealand. 
</p>

Other bases have been established including Vanda Station on the shores of Lake Vanda in 
the Dry Valley region of Victoria Land on the Antarctic continent proper, and at Cape Bird on 
the northern tip of Ross Island, 100 kilometres from Scott Base. 
The seasons govern the population and the work carried out.<br>

<br>
Due to its geographical position, New Zealand has been used as a staging point from many Antarctic expeditions 
and this has forged close links with the southernmost continent.  
New Zealand's involvement in Antarctica is the topic of special stamp issue featuring 4 stamps depicting 
areas in which some of the most important studies are currently being made - 
<strong>geology</strong>, biology, glaciology and meteorology. <br>

<br>
<strong>Geological Research</strong> - at Shapeless Mountain:<br>
New Zealand geologists have for many years conducted study programmes of the Beacon Supergroup rock
formations of Shapeless Mountain and Mt Fleming at the head of the Wright
Valley in the Dry Valley's region of Antarctica. <br>

<br>
Studies carried by New Zealanders in <a href="../../country/ross.html">the Ross Dependency</a> have led 
to a great variety of <strong>fossil</strong> discoveries. 
These remnants are evidence of the likely measure of mineral deposits they can expect to find in this
land. <br>
<br>
The first plant fossil discovered in Antarctica was discovered by Robert Falcon Scott in 1912, 
during his second, fatal, expedition. <br>

<p class="notes">
  <a href="../../topics/paleo/contributors.html#scott"><strong>Robert Falcon Scott</strong></a>  
  CVO (6 June 1868 – 29 March 1912) was British Royal Navy officer and explorer
  who led two expeditions to the Antarctic regions: <br>
  the <u>Discovery expedition</u> of 1901–1904 and <br>
  the ill-fated <u>Terra Nova expedition</u> of 1910–1912. <br>
  On the first expedition, he set a new southern record by marching to latitude 82°S and discovered the 
  Antarctic Plateau, on which the South Pole is located. <br>
  On the second venture, Scott led a party of five which reached the South Pole on 17 January 1912.
  Scott and his companions died on the second expedition.
</p>

When Scott and his party's bodies were discovered, 
16kg of <em>Glossopteris tree</em> (<em>an extinct beech-like tree from 250 million years ago</em>) 
<em>fossils</em> from Queen Maud Mountains were found next to their bodies, 
which they had dragged on hand sledges. <br>

These fossils promised to <a href="../../topics/paleo/paleontologist.html#m_stopes">Marie Stopes</a> 
were to provide evidence for <a href="../../topics/paleo/paleontologist.html#suess">Eduard Suess</a>’s 
hypothesis that Antarctica had once been part of an ancient supercontinent named Gondwanaland 
(or also referred to as Gondwana).<br>

The plant fossils Scott’s party found on that day in 1912 led to a breakthrough in 
the geological understanding of Antarctica. 
It would feed into the burgeoning debate at that time on Gondwanaland, Continental Drift 
and Antarctica’s role in the formation of the continents.
At the end it proved that Antarctica had once been warm and connected to other continents as
suggested by <a href="#suess">Eduard Suess</a>, as the same fossils are found in 
<a href="../../country/australia.html">Australia</a>, Africa and South America, it was
like finding a missing piece of the Earth's jigsaw. 
It indicated that these countries had all been part of the same prehistoric land mass.<br>

        Biological Research - Seal Colonies: <br>
        New Zealand scientists have contributed to extensive research into seal colonies. 
        These colonies abound in the Ross Dependency and in the coastal areas of Ross Island.
        Although once threatened by over-exploitation, Antarctic seal colonies have shown a
        marked increase in numbers recently, and care is taken to ensure minimum human impact 
        on the colonies. <br>

        New Zealand biologists have gained considerable knowledge about the
        primitive forms of life that survive in the narrow life-support zones of the
        Antarctic. 
        Birds, seals and fish have been found to have unique body
        mechanisms for withstanding the abnormal environment of the Antarctic. 
        Studies by New Zealand biologists have provided data of considerable value to the wider 
        field of human biology and medicine.

      Glaciological Research - 'Winkle' Drilling:<br>
      'Winkle' drilling equipment has been used by

      Industrial Research (DSIR) and the United States Geological Survey for
      a drilling programme in the Lower  Taylor Valley where they are working
      to decipher the late <strong>Cenozoic glacial history</strong>. 
      Core samples obtained from  drill holes ranging in depth between
      80 and 120 metres have, after  analysis, added considerably to the
      geological knowledge and history of the region.

      Both New Zealand's Scott Base and Vanda Station (established in 1968, specifically

      important meteorological studies. 
      These include daily climatic observations along with continuous wind, temperature, pressure and 
      solar radiation recordings. 
      These observations provide data which is regularly transmitted to the New Zealand Meteorological
      Service.
