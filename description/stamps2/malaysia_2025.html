<br>

On June 30<sup>th</sup>, 2025, the Postal Authority of Malaysia, 
issued a set of four stamps "Fossil Discoveries in Malaysia". <br>
Each stamp features a fossil, a reconstruction of the prehistoric animal, 
a human silhouette for scale, and a map showing the fossil discovery site.
This special issue commemorates key scientific milestones in Malaysian paleontology, 
offering a curated glimpse into the country’s rich prehistoric heritage. <br>
Depicting species from both the Cretaceous Period (approximately 145 to 66 million years ago) 
and the Pleistocene Epoch (roughly 2.58 million to 11,700 years ago), the stamps highlight 
not only the vast span of geological time, but also the enduring scientific value of fossil discoveries 
in shaping our understanding of natural history.<br>

These stamps were sold by Pos Malaysia in a collector’s folder, which included two stamp sheets, 
a First Day Cover (FDC) cancelled at the Kuala Lumpur General Post Office (GPO), and an information flyer. 
The inside and outside of the folder featured the same content as the flyer. <br>

<br>
Although <a href="../../country/malaysia.html">Malaysia</a>  has not traditionally 
been recognized for fossil discoveries, 
interest in its paleontological potential has grown significantly in recent decades.
Collaborative research with international institutions has 
led to the identification and cataloguing of previously unknown specimens. 

Ongoing efforts by local universities, museums, and government agencies continue to develop 
a national fossil record, contributing to both regional and global understanding of prehistoric life. <br>
The release of this stamp series reflects a growing awareness of the importance of paleontological 
research, not only as a scientific pursuit but also as a vital cultural and educational resource. <br>



<br>
Fossils are invaluable records of Earth’s prehistoric past.
They provide direct evidence of the evolution of life, environmental changes, and the biodiversity 
of long-extinct ecosystems. 
By studying fossils, researchers can trace species lineages, explore ancient ecological relationships, 
and reconstruct past climates and landscapes. <br>
Although still developing, Malaysia’s fossil record holds significant scientific value and continues 
to offer new insights into the region’s natural history.
<ul>
	<li>Archaeological work in Niah Cave, Sarawak, revealed a range of animal fossils, including those of 
		extinct megafauna such as the Giant Pangolin and prehistoric tiger. 
	</li>
	<li>In 2014, an <em>Iguanodon</em>'s tooth fossil was unearthed in Terengganu, suggesting that 
		the region was once part of a dynamic, dinosaur-inhabited world. </li>
	<li>A fossilized tooth of the <em>Stegodon</em> - a type of prehistoric elephant  was discovered in 
		Perak's Kinta Valley Geopark area, in 2020. </li>
</ul>

<h2>The prehistoric animals depicted on the stamps</h2>

<a name="iguanodon"></a>
<h3>Iguanodon</h3>
Reaching a length of about 10 meters, <em>Iguanodon</em> stood nearly 2 metres tall at the hip, and weighed 
four to five tons. 
It was an herbivore that likely consumed around 30 kilograms of plants each day. 
The dinosaur probably spent most of its time grazing while moving about on all four legs, 
although it was capable of walking on two legs. 
<em>Iguanodon</em> was one of the most successful dinosaurs, with fossils discovered across 
Europe, North Africa, North America, and <a href="../../country/australia.html">Australia</a>. <br>

<br>
Two small dinosaur teeth, each about 1.5 cm long, were discovered in ex-situ conglomerate boulders, 
near Mount Gagau in the Kenyir Lake region of Hulu Terengganu, Malaysia. 
The teeth were identified as belonging to iguanodontians, a group of herbivorous dinosaurs 
related to genus <em>Iguanodon</em>.
Due to the fragmentary nature of the fossils, they were assigned to <em>Iguanodon indet.</em> 
(indeterminate species).  <br>
The discovery was made during the 10-day "Gagau–Menjejak Dinosaur Expedition", held from October 13 to 22, 
2014. 
The expedition team included researchers from 
Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia (National University of Malaysia), 
Universiti Malaya (University of Malaya), 
Universiti Teknologi Petronas (Petronas University of Technology), and 
Universiti Malaysia Kelantan (University of Kelantan Malaysia). 
They were joined by two officers from the Terengganu Wildlife and National Parks Department 
and ten officers from the Department of Minerals and Geoscience. <br>

The expedition was led by Professor Datuk Yunus Abdul Razak, Director-General of the 
Mineral and Geoscience Department of Malaysia, who served as both the project leader 
and official spokesperson. <br>

<p class="notes">	
	Note: "Datuk", sometimes spelled "Dato", is an honorary title awarded by Malaysian royalty 
	or state governors. 
	It holds a similar level of prestige to a knighthood in the United Kingdom, 
	such as the title “Sir.”
</p>

He emphasized the significance of the mission in confirming the presence of dinosaur fossils 
in Malaysia and in supporting the nomination of Kenyir Lake Geopark for UNESCO Global Geopark status. 
However, as of now, Kenyir Lake Geopark has not yet been recognized by UNESCO.<br>
<p>
	<q><em>Mount Gagau is located at the Terengganu-Kelantan-Pahang border, where the expedition also found plant fossils, 
		   petrified wood and outcrops of coal in Sungai Pertang.
		   I am confident this finding will strengthen and add value to our hopes to turn the Kenyir Lake Geopark into 
		   a National Geopark which is recognised as a UNESCO Global Geopark.</em></q>
</p>

Along with the teeth, the expedition uncovered fossilized dinosaur tracks from  three dinosaur groups: 
iguanodontids, theropods, and sauropods. 
These tracks were found at six different sites. 
Additionally, the team discovered four fossilized bones from theropods and sauropods, as well as plant 
fossils and petrified wood. 
Geological analysis suggests these fossils originated from Jurassic–Cretaceous red-bed formations, 
similar to those in nearby <a href="thailand_1997.html">Thailand</a> and <a href="laos_1994.html">Laos</a>.
This marked the first confirmed discovery of dinosaur fossils in 
<a href="../../country/malaysia.html">Malaysia</a>, 
dating back to the Late Cretaceous (approximately 145–66 million years ago). <br>

The species <em>Iguanodon</em> was the second dinosaur species to be named and was named based 
on the discovery of some teeth.
Mary Ann Mantell (1795 - 1869), wife of  
<a href="../../topics/paleo/paleontologist.html#mantell">Dr. Gideon Algernon Mantell</a> (1790 - 1852), 
an English surgeon, geologist and amateur <a href="../../topics/paleo/paleontologist.html">palaeontologist</a>, 
discovered the first tooth in 1822, while accompanying her husband on a trip to visit 
a patient in Sussex, <a href="../../country/uk.html">England</a>. 
She noticed something glinting by the side of the road. <br>
Dr. Gideon Mantell formally published his findings on February 10<sup>th</sup>, 1825, 
when he presented a paper on the remains to the Royal Society of London. 
In this paper he described several prehistoric teeth from the Wealden district of East Sussex and 
named the prehistoric animal - <em>Iguanodon</em>, meaning "iguana tooth".

In 1883, the holotype specimen of <em>Iguanodon bernissartensis</em> became one of the first ever dinosaur 
skeletons mounted for display, after over 30 relatively complete skeletons of <em>Iguanodon</em> 
were discovered by miners digging at 322 metres below the surface near the town of Bernissart, 
<a href="belgium_2015.html#iguanodon">Belgium</a> in 1878. <br>

<h3><em>Stegodon</em></h3>
<em>Stegodon</em> is primarily an Asiatic group of mammutid origin.

This family is believed to have evolved during the Middle Miocene, nearly 15 million years ago 
and became extinct by the Late Pleistocene about 30,000 - 40,000 years ago. <br>

<em>Stegodon</em> appears to be transitional forms between true mastodons and true elephants.
Like elephants, <em>Stegodon</em> were likely good swimmers. 
Their fossils are frequently found on Asian islands, even during periods of low sea level 
in the cold phases of the Pleistocene, were not connected to the Asian mainland by land bridges.. <br>
<br>
Note: <a href="../../milestones.html">the first stamp featuring prehistoric animals</a>, 
      issued by India was released in 1951 to commemorate the 
	  "<a href="india_1951.html"><em>Centenary of Geological Survey of India</em></a>", 
      depicted a pair of <em>Stegodon</em>. <br>
<br>
A general evolutionary trend in large mammals on islands is island dwarfism. 
The smallest dwarf species, <em>Stegodon sondaari</em>, found in 900,000 year old layers on the 
Indonesian island of Flores, had an estimated body weight of 300 kg, smaller than a water buffalo. <br>
A medium- to large-sized stegodont, <em>Stegodon florensis</em>, with a body weight of about 850 kg, 
appeared about 850,000 years ago and later evolved into a dwarf form, <em>Stegodon florensis insularis</em>.
The latter was contemporaneous with the hominin  <em>Homo floresiensis</em>, discovered in 2003, 
and disappeared approximately 12,000 years ago. <br>


<br>
Malaysia’s first <em>Stegodon</em> fossil is a juvenile cheek tooth, 
was discovered in 2020 by a multidisciplinary team from Universiti Malaya and 
the Paleontological Society of Malaysia. 
The team was led by Dr. Ros Fatihah Muhammad from the Department of Geology, Faculty of Science, 
and Mr. Lim Tze Tshen, a vertebrate <a href="../../topics/paleo/paleontologist.html">paleontologist</a> 
and zooarchaeologist from the Paleontological Society of Malaysia.  
The find was made in a limestone cave in Kinta Valley Geopark, Gopeng, Perak, 
following information received from the cave conservation group, Kinta Valley Watch. <br>

<p>
	During a routine cave exploration in Gopeng on July 26<sup>th</sup>, 2020, members of the 
	Kinta Valley Watch group discovered a peculiar object approximately 70 cm above the cave floor. 
	After examining photographs and inspecting the object in <em>situ</em> within its surrounding sediments, 
	and following consultations with several experts from the Geological Society of Malaysia, 
	the find was identified as a <em>Stegodon</em> cheek tooth.
</p>

The tooth, depicted on the lower portion of the stamp, was found embedded in cave sediments estimated 
to be between 30,000 and 80,000 years old. 
Dental analysis suggests it belonged to a young <em>Stegodon</em>, likely under two years of age. 
According to the Geological Society of Malaysia, this fossil, along with related geological evidence, 
can help address key research questions about the evolution and migration of mammals, 
as well as their adaptations to environmental changes in this region during the Quaternary Period. 
Given its strategic position between mainland and island Southeast Asia, Peninsular 
<a href="../../country/malaysia.html">Malaysia</a>  
likely served as a crucial migration corridor for prehistoric land mammals and early humans. <br>

<h3>Giant Pangolin (<em>Manis palaeojavanica</em>)</h3>

The Giant Pangolin (<em>Manis palaeojavanica</em>) is an extinct species of pangolin that was native to Asia.  <br>
Unlike its modern relatives, the Giant Pangolin was remarkably large, 
estimates suggest it may have reached lengths of up to 3 meters, making it nearly 2.5 times the size of 
the living Sunda Pangolin (<em>Manis javanica</em>).  
Despite its size, this ancient pangolin likely shared similar habits, such as feeding on ants and termites, 
and was well-adapted to the dense tropical forests that once covered much of Borneo.	<br>

<br>
Bones of a single Giant Pangolin were discovered in Niah Cave, Sarawak, on the island of Borneo, 
<a href="../../country/malaysia.html">Malaysia</a>, between 1954 and 1958. 
This fossil, the thigh and arm bones, are depicted on the lower portion of the stamp. 
Additional fossils of the Giant Pangolin were later uncovered during excavations in the 1960s. <br>
The bones were first identified in 1960 by Dutch paleontologist Dr. Dirk Albert Hooijer (1919 – 1993), 
who specialized in prehistoric pangolins of Southeast Asia.  

<p class="notes">
	Dirk Albert Hooijer (1919–1993) was a prominent Dutch paleontologist known for his extensive work on fossil mammals, 
	particularly in Southeast Asia. 
	He specialized in prehistoric proboscideans (elephants and their relatives), rhinoceroses, and primates. 
	Hooijer worked at the Rijksmuseum van Natuurlijke Historie (now Naturalis Biodiversity Center) in Leiden 
	and published widely on fossils from Indonesia, Malaysia, and beyond. 
	His research helped shape understanding of Pleistocene fauna in the region, including contributions 
	to the study of <a href="#stegodon">Stegodon</a> and the extinct Giant Pangolin (<em>Manis palaeojavanica</em>).
</p>

Hooijer compared the Sarawak fossils with specimens previously found in Java, <a href="../../country/indonesia.html">Indonesia</a>. 
Based on their similarities, he classified the Sarawak specimens as <em>Manis palaeojavanica</em>, 
a species first described in 1907 by another renowned Dutch 
<a href="../../topics/paleo/paleontologist.html">paleontologist</a> Eugene Dubois. <br>

<p class="notes">
	Marie Eugène François Thomas Dubois (1858 – 1940) was a Dutch geologist and 
	<a href="../../topics/anthro/antropologist.html">paleoanthropologist</a> best known for discovering 
	<em>Pithecanthropus erectus</em>, now classified as <em>Homo erectus</em>, also known as "Java Man." 
	His ground-breaking work in Indonesia marked the first intentional search for human ancestors based 
	on <a href="../../articles/evolution.html">evolutionary theory</a>. 
	While Dubois did not work directly in Malaysia, his research had an important influence on the study 
	of Southeast Asian paleontology more broadly. <br>
	One of his notable contributions to the fossil record relevant to Malaysia was the first scientific 
	description of the extinct giant pangolin, <em>Manis palaeojavanica</em>, in 1907. 
	Dubois’s classification provided the taxonomic foundation for later researchers, such as Dr. Dirk Hooijer, 
	to identify and compare fossil remains from Malaysia and Indonesia, highlighting the prehistoric faunal connections across Sundaland.
</p>

The fossils were found in cave sediments estimated to be between 32,000 and 40,000 years old. 
These findings place the remains in the Late Pleistocene, the same period during which 
prehistoric humans lived in the cave. 
It is possible that they hunted the Giant Pangolins. 
The morphological similarities supported the classification of the Niah Cave specimens as <em>Manis palaeojavanica</em>, 
a now-extinct species that once ranged across Sundaland, a prehistoric landmass that connected parts of 
present-day Southeast Asia. 
The presence of the Giant Pangolin (<em>Manis palaeojavanica</em>) in both 
Java (<a href="../../country/indonesia.html">Indonesia</a>) and 
Borneo (<a href="../../country/malaysia.html">Malaysia</a>) supports the theory that prehistoric land bridges 
allowed for the migration of species across Sundaland during periods of lowered sea levels. <br>

<br>
The Niah Cave site has proven to be a treasure trove of prehistoric biodiversity. 
In addition to the Giant pangolin (<em>Manis palaeojavanica</em>) fossils, researchers have unearthed 
remains of other large mammals such as <a href="#tiger">tigers</a>, tapirs, and rhinoceroses. 
The co-occurrence of these species suggests that Borneo's ancient ecosystem supported a variety of 
<a href="australia_2008.html">Megafauna</a> and maintained forested 
conditions throughout much of the Pleistocene. 
Furthermore, the discovery of both giant and modern pangolin remains within the same strata indicates 
that they may have coexisted for a time. 
This overlap provides valuable insights into species turnover and extinction dynamics influenced by 
environmental change or human activity. <br>

<h3>Tiger (<em>Panthera tigris</em>)</h3>

Malaysia’s prehistoric fossil record shows that tigers (<em>Panthera tigris</em>) once roamed the region 
during the Late Pleistocene and Holocene. 
Today, wild tigers still survive in Peninsular Malaysia. 
However, recent surveys estimate that fewer than 150 Malayan tigers (<em>Panthera tigris jacksoni</em>) 
remain in the wild. <br>

In contrast, ancient tiger populations on the island of Borneo (East Malaysia) are now extinct.  
Nevertheless, the tiger features prominently in local folklore and traditions among several Bornean 
ethnic groups. 
Tiger parts, including skins and canine teeth, have also been found in the possession of interior communities. 
Additionally, its presence has also been attested by unsubstantiated sight records.  <br>
Local indigenous traditions, including tiger-themed amulets and motifs, further support the notion of a 
long-standing tiger presence. <br>


<br>	
A canine tooth from a young tiger, shown in the lower portion of the stamp, was discovered at Niah Cave. 
The tooth dated to approximately 13,000 and 3,000 years ago. 
It was found among around 750,000 bone fragments excavated between 1954 and 1966, by 
a team from the Sarawak Museum, led by Tom Harrisson, the museum's curator. <br>
Although Dr. Dirk Albert Hooijer was not directly involved in the excavation, he played an important role 
in  analyzing the fossil remains. 
In 1963, Dr. Hooijer identified the specimen as the upper canine tooth of a young tiger 
(<em>Panthera tigris</em>). 
Today, this tooth is part of the collection of the Paleontological Department at the Naturalis Biodiversity Center in Leiden, 
<a href="../../country/netherlands.html">the Netherlands</a>. <br>
However, the presence of this tiger tooth in Neolithic sediments was not enough to confirm that tigers were 
part of Borneo’s native fauna. 
Tiger teeth have long held cultural or ornamental value, and could have been transported over great distances, 
even in prehistoric times. 
Ancient trade networks are known to have connected island Southeast Asia with the mainland. 
Some researchers suggest that even a live tiger cub might have been brought to Borneo through these trade routes. <br>

<br>
It was not until 2007 that <a href="../../topics/paleo/paleontologist.html">paleontologists</a> found and 
described additional tiger (<em>Panthera tigris</em>) fossils on the island of Borneo, including metacarpal 
bone fragments. 
The discovery provided firm evidence that tigers did indeed inhabit Borneo during the Late Pleistocene and 
Early Holocene (approximately 126,000 - 8,200 years ago).
The reason for the tiger's extinction on Borneo, however, remains unknown. <br>
