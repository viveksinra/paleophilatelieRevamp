</center><br>The UNESCO General Conference 
approved on the 16th November 1972 in Paris an agreement on the protection of 
the world, cultural and natural Heritage. The idea to create an international 
movement to protect cultural areas and nature was born in the second post-war 
period. The Agreement forces the Member States to regularly supply a report on 
the state of preservation of the registered areas. It encourages the public 
awareness about the world protected areas and improves the preservation by 
educational and informative programmes . "To preserve our heritage for the 
future generations" it is a must that the Agreement and the Member States fixed 
as a goal and warning. Today, after forty years from the signature of the 
agreement, the world heritage is well understood, so much that registered areas 
receive international cooperation, mutual help and management models. With the 
souvenir-sheet designed by M. Ventura, "From Pyramids to Galapagos, to the 
whole world" the Azienda Autonoma di Stato Filatelica e Numismatica of the 
ancient Republic of San Marino makes the first issue after the agreement signed 
on the 3rd November 2011 in the UNESCO official seat where the "Progetto San 
Marino-Unesco" was accepted; a long-term cooperation to increase the value of 
Humanity Heritage through the philately of San Marino. The first stamp of the 
serie shows, among other goods, the "Historic centre and Mount Titano" in 
foreground as part of the world humanity area 
heritage.<br>
Two stamps on the right side of the block are related to Galapagos 
Islands. The Galapagos Islands (official name: Archipilago de Colon; other 
Spanish names: Islas de Colon or Islas Galapagos) are an archipelago of volcanic 
islands distributed around the equator in the Pacific Ocean, 972 km (525 nmi) 
west of continental Ecuador, of which they are a part.

The voyage of the Beagle brought 
the survey ship HMS Beagle, under captain Robert FitzRoy, to the Galapagos on 15 
September 1835 to survey approaches to harbours. The captain and others on 
board, including his companion, the young naturalist Charles Darwin, made 
observations on the geology and biology on Chatham, Charles, Albemarle and James 
islands before they left on 20 October to continue on their round-the-world 
expedition. Primarily a geologist at the time, Darwin was impressed by the 
quantity of volcanic craters they saw, later referring to the archipelago as 
"that land of craters." His study of several volcanic formations over the 5 
weeks he stayed in the islands, led to several important geological discoveries, 
including the first, correct explanation for how volcanic tuff is formed. Darwin 
noticed the mockingbirds differed between islands, though he thought the birds 
now known as Darwin's finches were unrelated to each other, and did not bother 
labelling them by island. The Englishman Nicolas Lawson, acting Governor of 
Galapagos for the Republic of the Equator, met them on Charles Island, and as 
they walked to the prison colony, told Darwin the tortoises differed from island 
to island. Towards the end of the voyage, Darwin speculated that the 
distribution of the mockingbirds and the tortoises might "undermine the 
stability of Species". When specimens of birds were analysed on his return to 
England, it was found that many apparently different kinds of birds were species 
of finches, which were unique to islands. These facts were crucial in Darwin's 
development of his theory of natural selection explaining evolution, which was 
presented in The 
Origin of Species (full name "On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural 
Selection").<br>
The fact that evolution occurs became accepted by the scientific 
community and much of the general public in his lifetime, while his theory of 
natural selection came to be widely seen as the primary explanation of the 
process of evolution in the 1930s, and now forms the basis of modern 
evolutionary theory. In modified form, Darwin's scientific discovery is the 
unifying theory of the life sciences, providing logical explanation for the 
diversity of life.Darwin's work had far-reaching impacts on the development of 
Paleontology, Antropology and many other Biology and Psyology related scients. 
This work changed our view on origin of life and provided and explanation about 
fossils found everywhere ariund the world. Nowadays we are not belive in 
dragons and seamaid and not associate a huge bones to some titans or any other 
kind of mythological creatures. Every modern child knows who is Dinosaurs 
and Pterosaurs. On the second stamp from right is Charles Darwin on the background and 
 pterosaur (probably Eudimorphodon ranzil).<br>
