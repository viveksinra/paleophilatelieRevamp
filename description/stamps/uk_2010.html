This year is the 350th anniversary of The Royal Society, the worlds
oldest scientific academy in continuous existence. In celebration,
Royal Mail has today released ten 1st class commemoratives featuring
significant Royal Society figures whose portraits are paired with
dramatic and colourful imagery representing their achievements. <br>
The brainstorming design was the idea of Hat-trick Design, responsible
for the interlocking jigsaw approach used for the <a href="uk_2009.html">2009 Darwin stamps</a>. But with
more than 1,400 Fellows and Foreign Members to choose from, how were
ten significant scientific figures to be selected?<br>
Fittingly, it was The Royal Society itself which suggested the
solution: a case of basic division. It was agreed to split the 350-year
history into ten 35-year blocks in which it could be demonstrated how,
through the work of its Fellows, The Royal Society has had a major
impact on the World.<br>
Royal Mail consulted with experts from the Society to determine the ten
Fellows, and due to the global nature of the organisation, non UK
citizens were included, such as one of the United States Founding
Fathers, Benjamin Franklin, and the New Zealand-born physicist Ernest
Rutherford.<br>
Founded in 1660, The Royal Society celebrates its 350th Anniversary in
2010 and as the National Academy of Science of the UK and the
Commonwealth. It maintains its position at the forefront of inquiry and
discovery, and at the cutting edge of scientific progress.<br>
The backbone of the society, which is a charitable body, is its
fellowship of the most eminent scientists of the day, and there are
currently more than 60 Nobel Laureates amongst the societys Fellows and
Foreign Members, of which there are more than 1,400. To this day,
Fellowship of The Royal Society is one the greatest honours that can be
conferred on any scientist.<br>
The origins of the society lie in an invisible college of natural
philosophers who first met in the mid 1640s and were united by a common
desire to better understand the world and the universe through
observation and experimentation. This spirit of empirical observation
is encapsulated in the societys Latin motto, nullius in verba, which
can be roughly translated as take nobodys word for it.<br>

Boyle</span>, Chemistry<br>
Boyle (1627 1691) was a natural philosopher, chemist, physicist,
inventor, and gentleman scientist, also noted for his writings in
theology. He is best known for the formulation of Boyles Law. Although
his research and personal philosophy clearly has its roots in the
alchemical tradition, he is largely regarded today as the first modern
chemist, and therefore one of the founders of modern chemistry. Among
his works, The Sceptical Chymist is seen as a cornerstone book in the
field of chemistry.</td>

Newton</span>, Optics<br>
Newton (1643 1727) was an English physicist, mathematician, astronomer,
natural philosopher, alchemist, and theologian who is perceived and
considered by many as one of the most influential men in history. His
Philosophi Naturalis Principia Mathematica, published in 1687, is by
itself considered to be among the most influential books in the history
of science, laying the groundwork for most of classical mechanics. In
this work, Newton described universal gravitation and the three laws of
motion which dominated the scientific view of the physical universe for
the next three centuries. Newton was also president of The Royal
Society. The 300th anniversary of Principia Mathematica was marked by a
set of four stamps in 1987.</td>

Franklin</span>, Electricity<br>
Franklin (1706 1790) was one of the Founding Fathers of the United
States of America. A noted polymath, Franklin was a leading author and
printer, satirist, political theorist, politician, scientist, inventor,
civic activist, statesman, soldier, and diplomat. As a scientist, he
was a major figure in the Enlightenment and the history of physics for
his discoveries and theories regarding electricity. He was important in
the development of scientific experimentation and invented the
lightning rod, bifocals, the Franklin stove, a carriage odometer, and
the glass armonica. <br>
In between his other achievements, the polymath Franklin found time to
examine fossils from Kentucky's Big Bone Lick. Stumped by what he
found, collector George Croghan sent specimens to Franklin, who
examined them in 1767. Franklin recognized some similarities to <span style="font-weight: bold;">elephants</span>, but also
some important differences. In fact, he was looking at <span style="font-weight: bold;">mastodon </span>remains.
He speculated that "perhaps the climates were differently placed from
what they are at present." Widespread acceptance of the notion of
extinction was decades away, and <span style="font-weight: bold;">Charles
Darwin's</span> proposal of natural selection lay nearly a
century in the future. Like <span style="font-weight: bold;">Thomas
Jefferson</span>, Franklin preferred migration to extinction in
explaining why the animals no longer lived in the same place. Although
Charles Darwin's hypothesis was a long way off, Franklin was friends
with the naturalist's grandfather, <span style="font-weight: bold;">Erasmus
Darwin</span>. </td>

Evolution</strong><br>
Wallace (1823 1913) was a British naturalist, explorer, geographer,
anthropologist and biologist. He is best known for independently
proposing a theory of natural selection which prompted the joint
reading of his and Charles Darwins papers on evolution in 1858, and
spurred Darwin to publish his own theory the following year. Wallace
did extensive fieldwork, first in the Amazon River basin and then in
the Malay Archipelago, where he identified the Wallace Line that
divides the Indonesian archipelago into two distinct parts, one in
which animals closely related to those of Australia are common, and one
in which the species are largely of Asian origin. He was considered the
19th century's leading expert on the geographical distribution of
animal species and is sometimes called the "father of biogeography".
Wallace was one of the leading evolutionary thinkers of the 19th
century and made a number of other contributions to the development of
evolutionary theory besides being co-discoverer of natural selection.
These included the concept of warning colouration in animals, and the
Wallace effect, a hypothesis on how natural selection could contribute
to speciation by encouraging the development of barriers against
hybridization.<br>

Jenner (17 May 1749 26 January 1823) is widely credited as the pioneer
of smallpox vaccine, and is sometimes referred to as the Father of
Immunology. Jenner observed that milkmaids rarely got smallpox and
concluded that exposure to the bovine disease cowpox conferred immunity
a theory he tested and proved by injecting a child with pus from cowpox
blisters. Jenners development of the smallpox vaccine was marked by a
20p stamp in the Patients Tale Millenium set in March 1999.</td>

Lister</span>, Antiseptic Surgery<br>
Lister, 1st Baron Lister, (1827 1912) was an English surgeon who
promoted the idea of sterile surgery while working at the Glasgow Royal
Infirmary. He successfully introduced carbolic acid (phenol) to
sterilize surgical instruments and to clean wounds, which led to
reduced post-operative infections and made surgery safer for patients.
The centenary of Listers discovery of Antispectic Surgery was marked by
two stamps issued in 1965.</td>

Rutherford, 1st Baron Rutherford of Nelson, (1871 1937) was a New
Zealand born chemist and physicist who became known as the father of
nuclear physics. He discovered that atoms have a small charged nucleus,
and thereby pioneered the Rutherford model (or planetary model, which
later evolved into the Bohr model or orbital model) of the atom,
through his discovery of Rutherford scattering with his gold foil
experiment. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1908. He is
widely credited as splitting the atom in 1917 and leading the first
experiment to split the nucleus in a controlled manner by two students
under his direction, John Cockcroft and Ernest Walton in 1932. He was
also president of The Royal Society.</td>

Dorothy Hodgkin</span>, Crystallography<br>
The stamp marks the centenary of the birth of Dorothy Mary Hodgkin,
(1910 1994). She was a British chemist, credited with the development
of Protein crystallography. She advanced the technique of X-ray
crystallography, a method used to determine the three dimensional
structures of biomolecules. Hodgkin was also the first female Briton to
win a Nobel Prize. Hodgkin was also featured on a 20p Famous Women
stamp in 1998.</td>

Earth Sciences<br>
Sir Nicholas John Shackleton was a British geologist and climatologist
who specialised in the Quaternary Period. He was the son of the
distinguished field geologist Robert Millner Shackleton and
great-nephew of the explorer Ernest Shackleton.<br>
In 1967 Cambridge awarded him a PhD degree, for his thesis entitled
'The Measurement of Paleotemperatures in the Quaternary Era'.
Shackleton was a key figure in the field of palaeoceanography,
publishing over two hundred scientific papers. He was a pioneer in the
use of mass spectrometry to determine changes in climate as recorded in
the oxygen isotope composition of calcareous microfossils. He also
found evidence that the Earth's last magnetic field reversal was
780,000 years ago.<br>
Shackleton became known, in 1976, with the publication of his paper,
with James Hays and John Imbrie, in Science entitled 'Products in the
Earth's orbit: Pacemaker of the ice ages'.Using ocean sediment cores,
the researchers demonstrated that oscillations in climate over the past
few million years could be correlated with variations in the orbital
and positional relationship between the Earth and the Sun</td>
