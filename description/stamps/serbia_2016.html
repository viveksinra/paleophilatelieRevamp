On February 23<sup>rd</sup>, 2016, the Post Authority of Serbia issued the stamp to commemorate
125<sup>th</sup> Anniversary of the Serbian Geological Society.
The building of the Society is shown on the background of the stamp and portrait of 
<strong>Jovan M. Zujovic</strong>, based on the painting by Uros Predic, is on the foreground. <br>
The stamp was issued in a Mini-Sheet of eight with one label in the middle.
The label shows a <em>Perisphinctes</em> ammonite, geological hammer and the medal with portrait of Zujovic.

The <strong>Serbian Geological Society</strong> is one of our oldest scientific organizations and the first 
geologists’ society in the Balkans. 
At the time of its creation, there were only two more “learned societies” in Serbia –
Serbian Medical Society and Serbian Archeological Society. <br>
In the premises of the Belgrade Higher School, on 23 February 1891 a meeting was held when the
participants decided to found a society with the primary task 
“to perform geological investigations of Serbia and other countries of the Balkan Peninsula and to inform 
its members and other interested parties about the achievement in the field of geology and affiliated 
sciences”. 
The name of the society was given by Sima Lozanic, a professor of chemistry at the Belgrade Higher
School during his lectures in Germany. <br>
<br>
The members of the Serbian Geological Society were many great scientists and explorers, who left an important 
mark in Serbian and world science: <strong>Jovan Zujovic</strong> (the founder of the Society, minister
in several governments, rector of the Higher School, president of the Serbian Royal Academy), 
Jovan Cvijić (president of the Serbian Royal Academy),
Sava Urošević (rector of the Higher School), 
Milutin Milanković (world authority in the field of climate and celestial mechanics), 
Vladimir Laskarev (one of the most eminent European geologists). <br>

<p>
	<strong>Jovan M. Zujovic</strong> (1856, Brusnica, Gornji Milanovac - Belgrade, 1936) was an anthropologist, known as a 
	pioneer in geological and <strong>paleontological science in Serbia</strong>. 
	He is known, among other things, for his work in anthropology. <br>
	In his book, "Stone Age", published in 1893, relying mostly on French scientists, he reviewed the 
	contemporary state of knowledge in paleoanthropology. 
	Later, between 1927 and 1929, in the book "Genesis of the Earth and Our Country", he wrote about the 
	biological past of the Earth starting from the beginning of mankind. 
	The work takes particular interest in the history of the Balkan peninsula.
</p>

Many initiatives were taken at the Serbian Geological Society and one of the most important was a 
systematic geological mapping of the country, the result of which was the Basic Geological
Map of the entire territory of the ex – Yugoslavia, completed in the 1970s.
Seismological Institute, Museum of Natural History, Geological Institute in Belgrade,
as well as other scientific societies in Serbia were founded at the initiative of the Society’s members. 
In its history, the Society has become an active member of many international organizations where the views 
of geologists and geology of Serbia are supported: International Union of Geological Sciences,
Association of European Geological Societies, European Federation of Geologists and Carpathian
Balkan Geological Association. <br>
