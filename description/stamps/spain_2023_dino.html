Between April 19<sup>th</sup> and 23<sup>rd</sup>, 2023, Teruel hosted: 
the 61<sup>st</sup> National Philatelic Exhibition and Spanish Championship - EXFILNA 2023 
and 
the 28<sup>th</sup> National Exhibition of Youth Philately and Spanish Championship - JUVENIA 2023, 
as well as the 5<sup>th</sup> European Championship of Maximofilia.
<br>

<p>
   One of the <a href="../../exhibitions/index.html">exhibits</a>, made by García Díez, José Antonio - 
   "De los primeros pobladores al ser humano"
   <!-- "<a href="https://exposicionesfesofi.es/garcia-diez-jose-antonio-de-los-primeros-pobladores-al-ser-humano">De los primeros pobladores al ser humano</a>" -->
   (From the first dwellers to the human), was about animal evolution.
</p>

These events were organised by the Spanish Federation (FESOFI) and the Spanish Post (Correos). 
The exhibition was held under the patronage of the City of Teruel and the cooperation of the Royal Mint, 
the Aragonese Federation of Philatelic Associations, the Association of Dealers in Philately, 
Numismatics and Collectables, ANFIL, and EDIFIL publishers. <br>

Three places in Teruel hosted the shows:
<ul>
	<li>The Bank of Spain hosted the best collections of Master Class and Class of Champions, 
	    Traditional Class, Postal History Class and Philatelic Literature Class. 
	    In total 37 exhibits on  242 frames, plus Philatelic Literature corner.
	</li>
	<li>Youth Leisure Center hosted 
		Exfilna-Juvenia and V European Championship of Maximofilia in the Youth category

The event was attended by the director of Post Office Philately, Leire Díez Castro, 
the mayor of Teruel, Emma Buj, the president of the Spanish Federation of Philatelic 
Societies, José Antonio Arruego and the President of the Aragonese Federation of 
Philatelic Societies, José Ángel Campo Huerta. <br>
The mayor of Teruel welcomed the attendees and after her speech, the Aragonese and 
Spanish presidents of the Federation of Philatelic Societies presented the program of 
Exfilna and Juvenia. <br>
Subsequently, the Director of Philately announced the three stamps that 
Correos issued for this celebration.  <br>

The JUVENIA is biennial exhibition, every time it takes place in a different city and for the first 
time in its history it coincides with the celebration of the EXFILNA. 
Both exhibitions have 3 locations, but the one 
dedicated to youth concentrated its activities in the Youth Leisure Center. <br>

Being an exhibition aimed at a younger audience, the aim of Spanish Post was to 
continue the dinosaur-themed series that in <a href="spain_2015.html">2015</a> 
consisted of the 
<em>Ankylosaurus</em>, <em>Tyrannosaurus</em>, <em>Triceratops</em> and <em>Diplodocus</em> stamps; 
and in <a href="spain_2016.html">2016</a> the <em>Europelta</em>, <em>Pelecanimimus</em>, <em>Proa</em> 
and <em>Turiasaurus</em>. <br>
<br>

This year, the dinosaur chose was <em>Aragosaurus ischiaticus</em>. 
The stamp shows a reproduction of what the dinosaur looked like in life. 
On the tab is an illustration of several of the fossils of this animal. <br>


<br>
<a name="aragosaurus"></a>
<strong><em>Aragosaurus</em></strong> was a quadrupedal, herbivorous sauropod dinosaur 
with a large neck and tail and a small head.
The forelimbs of the dinosaur were shorter than the hindlimbs, although not as short as is common in 
camarasaurids. <br>
<em>Aragosaurus</em> teeth were spatulate in shape and ornamented by longitudinal 
grooves. 
Spatulate means that the teeth broaden towards their upper edge into a spoon-like 
or spatula-like shape. <br>

Its name means "Reptile of Aragon". <br>
<em>Aragosaurus</em> lived during the Upper Jurassic and the Lower Cretaceous 
(150-140 million years ago) periods and was about 17 meters long and about 25 tonnes 
in weight, who lived in the environments near the coastline of the Tethys Sea. <br> 


<!--

-->

<em>Aragosaurus ischiaticus</em> is the first dinosaur discovered in 
<a href="../../country/spain.html">Spain</a>.
It was described by Sanz, Buscalioni, Casanovas and Santafé in 1987, based on 
associated postcranial remains of one individual from the Las Zabacheras site 150m 
north of the village of Galve  in Teruel Province, Aragon, north-eastern Spain - 
the Villar del Arzobispo Formation. <br>

<p>
	The Villar del Arzobispo Formation in Spain reveals a high diversity of sauropods living on the 
	Iberian Plate during the Jurassic–Cretaceous transition. 
	To date, diplodocids, turiasaurs, and titanosauriforms have been recovered from Spanish rocks. <br>
	<em>Aragosaurus</em> is one of four genera of sauropod recovered from the Villar del Arzobispo Formation 
	in Spain, making the latter an important contributor to understanding of Late Jurassic sauropod diversity 
	alongside the well-known contemporaneous faunas of the African Tendaguru Formation in 
	<a href="../../country/tanzania.html">Tanzania</a>
	and the North American Morrison Formation (<a href="../../country/usa.html">USA</a>).

The fossils material found is inadequate for a formal description, so this taxon needs further 
documentation and analysis.  <br>
<em>Aragosaurus</em> was originally referred to the 
<a href="cuba_2013.html#dinosaur"><em>Camarasauridae</em></a>  and has been provisionally regarded
as <em>Eusauropoda incertae sedis</em> by Upchurch at al. in 2004.  <br>

The recent research supported by cladistic analysis suggest that <em>Aragosaurus ischiaticus</em> 
is a basal macronarian that is more closely related to Titanosauriformes than is <em>Camarasaurus</em>. <br>

<p>
	Macronaria is a clade of sauropod dinosaurs, named after the large diameter of 
	the nasal opening of their skull, known as the external naris (the nostrils), 
	which exceeded the size of the orbit, the skull opening where the eye is located.
</p>


<br>
In 1934, construction of the old road to Galve led to the discovery of the type locality, 
initially named ‘La Carretera’.  <br>
The first recorded discovery of dinosaur bones was in 1958, when a resident of the village, José María 
Herrero, reported dinosaur bones from Galve in the local newspaper "Lucha", and then informed the service 
of excavations of the Diputación Provincial de Teruel. <br>

Dimas Fernández-Galiano and Purificación Atrián, members of IET, visited Galve and 
located elements of <em>Aragosaurus</em> held in private hands by members of the local population.  <br>
After this, Fernández-Galiano returned to Galve in order to excavate new remains from the Las Zabacheras 
site, including some of the vertebrae and long bones. <br>
All of these elements, including those collected from villagers and the vertebrae and long bones collected 
later, were housed in the Museo Provincial de Teruel. <br>
Albert F. de Lapparent (1905–1975), from the Institut Catholique, Paris, was the first palaeontologist
to suggest that these remains represented a new taxon of sauropod in the scientific journal "Teruel". <br>

Subsequently, in 1982, a team of palaeontologists comprising researchers from the Universidad
Autónoma de Madrid and the Instituto de Paleontología de Sabadell 
(today the Institut Català de Paleontología) informed José María Herrero of the intention to excavate
the Las Zabacheras site during the following year; however, it transpired that José María Herrero
had already excavated part of the site, so an agreement was made to carry out joint fieldwork. <br>

The resulting material, known as the "J.M. Herrero Collection", enabled the first dinosaur from Spain to
be named: <em>Aragosaurus ischiaticus</em>. <br>
The holotype also included the material cited as ‘the sauropod from Las Zabacheras’ by Lapparent
(1960), and a tooth was referred from a nearby unnamed locality. <br>

As a result of these events, the holotype specimens are distributed between two collections: <br>
(1) the material recovered by Dimas Fernández-Galiano in the 1950s, which is deposited
at the Museo Provincial de Teruel with the acronym ‘IG’; <br>
and (2) the material excavated by J.M. Herrero and the team of author J.L.S. in the 1980s,
with acronym ‘ZH’, now in the Museo Paleontológico de Galve. <br>

<!-- ? 	
In 2001, on the occasion of the inauguration of the Dinópolis museum in Galve, two of us ... 
recovered the material ... deposited by Dimas Fernández-Galiano in the Museo Provincial de Teruel, moving
it to a satellite museum of Dinópolis in Galve (today belonging to the Museo Aragonés de Paleontologia), 
with the other specimens remaining in the Museo Paleontológico de Galve.
