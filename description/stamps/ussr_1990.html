The stamps shows reconstruction of some prehistorical animals
are on show in Paleontological
Museum of Russian Science Academy in Moscow. The building of
the museum is depicting on FDC covers.The Orlov
Museum of Paleontology was founded by
Paleontological Institute of Russian Academy of Sciencies in 1937 prior
to the XVII session of the International Geological Congress. It is
named after russian paleonthologist and academician Yuri Alexandrovich
Orlov (1893-1966). It contains public exhibits representing almost
every type of fossil organism. Particularly well represented are
dinosaurs from Mongolia, therapsids from the Perm region of Russia, and
Precambrian fossils from Siberia. Among them some unique
once such as Garjainia
and Titanophoneus.
<br>
The museum started out as a branch of the Zoological Museum
of Moscow University. When originally founded in 1937, the museum
occupied 700 sq. m. in a building on Bolshaya Kaluzhskaya Street.
During the World War II the museum was closed and the major part of
collection relocated to Alma-Ata.
In 1944 museum was reopened for the general
public, but in 1954 it was closed again due to the shortage of display
space. In 1965 the USSR Council of Ministers granted 2 million rubles
for the construction of the new museum building. However, construction
works started only in 1972. The renewed museum met the first visitors
in 1987.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Sordes</span>
was a small basal pterosaur from the Late Jurassic (Oxfordian -
Kimmeridgian) Karabastau Svita of Kazakhstan.<br>
The genus was named in 1971
by Aleksandr
Grigorevich Sharov. The type species is Sordes pilosus. The
genus name means "filth" or "scum" in Latin, a reference to evil
spirits in local folklore. The specific name is Latin for "hairy";
despite sordes being feminine, it has not yet been emended to pilosa.<br>
The genus is based on holotype PIN 2585/3, a crushed relatively
complete
skeleton on a slab. It was found in the sixties at the foothills of the
Karatau in Kazakhstan. The fossil shows remains of the soft parts, such
as membranes and hair. This was the first unequivocal proof that
pterosaurs had a layer of fur. The integument served as insulation, an
indication the group was warm-blooded, and provided a streamlined
flight profile. The hairlike structures (pycnofibres) are present in
two main types: longer at the extreme part of the wing membrane and
shorter near the body. In the 1990s, David Unwin argued that both types
were essentially not hairs but reinforcing fibres of the flight
membranes. Later he emphasized that "hair" in the form of fur was
indeed present on the body, after the find of new specimens clearly
showing this.
<br>
Sharov had already referred a paratype or second
specimen: PIN 2470/1, again a fairly complete skeleton on a slab. By
2003 another six specimens had been discovered.
Sordes had a 0.63 m (two feet) wingspan. The wings were
relatively short. It had a slender, not round, head with moderately
long, pointed jaws. The skull was about eight centimetres long. Its
teeth were widely spaced, small and slanted. It had a short neck. It
had a long tail, accounting for over half its length, with at the end
an elongated vane. Unlike many pterosaurs, it had no head crest. Sordes
had, according to Sharov and Unwin, wing membranes attached to the legs
and a membrane between the legs.
<br>
Sordes has been assigned to the family Rhamphorhynchidae.
These were among the earliest of the pterosaurs, evolving in the late
Triassic and surviving to the late Jurassic. Sordes probably ate small
prey, perhaps including insects and amphibians.<br>

<a href="../../images/details/stamps/official/ussr/1990/ussr_1990_2.jpg"><img title="Chalicotheres on stamp of USSR 1990" style="border: 0px solid ; width: 200px; height: 434px; float: left;" alt="Chalicotheres on stamp of USSR 1990" src="../../images/details/stamps/official/ussr/1990/preview/ussr_1990_2.jpg" hspace="0"></a><a href="../../images/details/stamps/official/ussr/1990/ussr_1990_3.jpg"><img title="Paraceratherium on stamp of USSR" style="border: 0px solid ; width: 200px; height: 434px; float: right;" alt="Paraceratherium on stamp of USSR" src="../../images/details/stamps/official/ussr/1990/preview/ussr_1990_3.jpg" hspace="0"></a><strong>Chalicotheres</strong>
were a group of herbivorous, odd-toed ungulate
(perissodactyl) mammals spread throughout North America, Europe, Asia,
and Africa during the Early Eocene to Early Pleistocene subepochs
living from 55.8 mya781,000 years ago, existing for approximately 55.02
million years.
They evolved around 40 million years ago from small,
forest animals similar to the early horses. Many chalicotheres,
including such animals as Moropus and Chalicotherium, reached the size
of a horse. By the late Oligocene, they had divided into two groups:
one that grazed in open areas and another that was more adapted to
woodlands. They died out around 3.5 million years ago, and are related
to the extinct brontotheres, as well as modern day horses,
rhinoceroses, and tapirs.
Unlike modern perissodactyls, chalicotheres had long
forelimbs and short hind limbs. Consequently, chalicotheres probably
moved with most of their weight on their short, strong hind legs. Their
front legs had long, curved claws indicating they knuckle-walked like
giant anteaters today. Fossil remains have shown thick, developed front
knuckles, much like gorillas. It was once thought that the claws were
used to dig up roots and tubers, however, the wear on the claws and
teeth do not suggest that they dug or ate dirt-rich foods such as
tubers. The chalicotheres probably used their claws to strip vegetation
from trees and to forage for food.
Chalicotheres did not have front teeth in their upper
jaw, and their back teeth show little wear, suggesting that they
probably were selective browsers.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Paraceratherium</span>,
also commonly known as Indricotherium or
Baluchitherium, is an extinct genus of gigantic hornless
rhinoceros-like mammals of the family Hyracodontidae, endemic to
Eurasia and Asia during the Eocene to Oligocene 37.223.030 Mya,
existing for approximately 14.17 million years. It was first discovered
in the Baluchistan province of Pakistan, hence the name, by Sir Clive
Forster Cooper.<br>
Paraceratherium is the largest land mammal known, larger than the
largest species of mammoths. It is also known as the "giraffe
rhinoceros". Adult Paraceratherium are estimated to have been 5.5
metres (18 ft) tall at the shoulder, 10 metres (33 ft) in length from
nose to rump, a maximum raised head height of about 8 metres (26 ft),
and a skull length of 1.5 metres (4.9 ft). Weight estimates vary
greatly, but most realistic and reliable weight estimates are about
20(30) tonnes. This puts it in the weight range of some medium-sized
sauropod dinosaurs.
<br>
It was a herbivore that stripped leaves from trees with
its down-pointing, tusk-like upper teeth that occluded forward-pointing
lower teeth. It had a long, low, hornless skull and vaulted frontal and
nasal bones. Its front teeth were reduced to a single pair of incisors
in either jaw, but they were conical and so large that they looked like
small tusks. The upper incisors pointed straight downwards, while the
lower ones jutted outwards. The upper lip was evidently extremely
mobile. The neck was very long, the trunk robust, and the limbs long
and thick, column-like.<br>
Its type of dentition, its mobile upper lip and its long
legs and neck indicate that it was a browser that lived on the leaves
and twigs of trees and large shrubs.<br>
<a href="../../images/details/stamps/official/ussr/1990/ussr_1990_4.jpg"><img title="Saurolophus on stamp of USSR 1990" style="border: 0px solid ; width: 200px; height: 434px; float: left;" alt="Saurolophus on stamp of USSR 1990" src="../../images/details/stamps/official/ussr/1990/preview/ussr_1990_4.jpg" hspace="0"></a> <br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Saurolophus</span>
a genus of large hadrosaurine duckbill that lived about 69.5-68.5
million years ago, in the Late Cretaceous of North America and Asia; it
is one of the few genera of dinosaurs known from multiple continents.
It is distinguished by a spike-like crest which projects up and back
from the skull. Saurolophus was a herbivorous dinosaur which could move
about either bipedally or quadrupedally.<br>
Barnum
Brown recovered the first described remains of Saurolophus in
1911, including a nearly complete skeleton. Now on display in the
American
Museum of Natural History, this skeleton was the first nearly
complete dinosaur skeleton from Canada. <br>
A complete skeleton of Saurolophus stored in the Museum
of Paleontology of Paleontological Institute, Academy of Sciences in
Moscow was found in Mongolia by expedition of I.A E fremov in
1947 at the seat of "the grave of the Dragon" in the mountains of Altan
Ula in southern Mongolian Gobi desert. Saurolophus also known
by several skeletons and many individual bones and skulls from the
Upper Cretaceous of Southern Mongolia. <a href="../../images/details/stamps/official/ussr/1990/ussr_1990_5.jpg"><img

<br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Thyestes</span> was an extinct genus of ostracoderm fish of Europe
that lived in the Lower Silurian Wenlock epoch. It superficially resembles
Cephalaspis, but was closely related to Auchenaspis and Tremataspis.<br>
