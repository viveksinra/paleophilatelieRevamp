On December 29<sup>th</sup>, 2025, the Ministry of Digital Development 
of the Kyrgyz Republic issued a new series of Kyrgyz Express Post (KEP) postage stamps 
titled “Prehistoric Fauna of Kyrgyzstan II”. <br>
<br>

The set contains three stamps:
<ul>
	<li>KGS 50 - postcard rate - <em>Rhamphorhynchinae indet.</em> <br> (a type of pterosaur)</li>
	<li>KGS 150 - regular letter with weight up to 50g. - <em>Tashkumyrodon desideratus</em> (an early mammal-like animal) </li>
	<li>KGS 300 - regular letter with weight up to 100g.  - <em>Alpkarakush kyrgyzicus</em> (a large theropod dinosaur)</li>
</ul>
<!--
  https://www.kep.kg/en/Rates/Show
-->

The stamps come in Mini-Sheets of five, each with a label showing fossils of prehistoric animals discovered in Kyrgyzstan. 
There is also a special Mini-Sheet featuring all three stamps with a lungfish (these fish possessed both gill and pulmonary respiration)
<em>Ferganoceratodus jurassicus</em> on the margin. <br>


Unlike <a href="kyrgyzstan_2024.html#mkogan">the first issue</a>, the author of this website was not involved in the design of this stamp set. 
As <a href="../../about.html">Michael Kogan</a> explains: <br>
<q><em>I received the final sketches of these stamps when it was already too late to make any changes. 
	The only modification I was able to implement was an elongation of the tail of the 
	<a href="#rhamphorhynchinae"><em>Rhamphorhynchinae</em></a></em></q>.

Millions of years ago, the territory of modern Kyrgyzstan was home to remarkable creatures,
whose remains today help paleontologists reconstruct the picture of the region's distant past. 
Unique fossils were discovered in the deposits of the Jurassic Period, reflecting the
richness and diversity of the region’s prehistoric fauna.  <br>
<br>

All four prehistoric animals featured on the stamps and the postmark were discovered in the Balabansai Formation is a fossil rich-unit. 
A site in western Kyrgyzstan where fossils were found in the Balabansai Formation is shown on the cachet of the FDC.  <br>

<p><a name="balabansai"></a>
    The <strong>Balabansai Formation</strong>, dating to 165 million years ago, was deposited by fluvial, lacustrine, and coastal processes. 
    The rock layers tell a story of rivers shifting, floodplains forming, and shallow lakes under a warm, seasonal climate.
	
	The formation stretched across what is now western Kyrgyzstan, 
	<a href="../../country/uzbekistan.html">Uzbekistan</a>, and south-eastern 
	<a href="../../country/kazakhstan.html">Kazakhstan</a> and has yielded an amazing variety of fossils, including dinosaurs, 
	turtles, amphibians, fish, 
	and some of the earliest mammal-like creatures. 
	These fossils show that Middle Jurassic Kyrgyzstan was a lively ecosystem with large herbivores, predators, small mammals, 
	and fish all living together.

Tiny teeth found in the <a href="#balabansai">Balabansai Formation</a> near Tash-Komur, 
one of the five largest towns in the Jalal‑Abad Region, belong to long-tailed pterosaurs called <em>Rhamphorhynchinae</em>. 
<a href="../../topics/paleo/paleontologist.html">Paleontologists</a> cannot determine the exact species from these fragments, 
but they offer a fascinating glimpse into the flying reptiles that lived in this region over 160 million years ago. <br>

<em>Rhamphorhynchinae</em> pterosaurs were small to medium-sized, early relatives of the more famous pterodactyls. 
They had long, stiff tails for stability in flight, short pointed beaks, and sharp teeth for catching fish or small prey. 
These creatures likely spent much of their time near rivers, lakes, or coastal areas, swooping down to snatch fish or insects from the water. <br>

Although only a few teeth were discovered, they prove that pterosaurs were part of Middle Jurassic ecosystems in Central Asia, 
bridging an important gap between finds in Europe and East Asia. 
The fossils suggest that flying reptiles were more widespread than previously thought. 
However, because we only have teeth, scientists cannot determine the full size or appearance of these animals, 
leaving much about their behavior and lifestyle a mystery. <br>

These small fossils are still scientifically valuable, helping researchers understand how pterosaurs spread across 
the ancient world and adapted to different environments. 
They also show that even fragmentary remains can reveal big stories about life millions of years ago.  <br>

<em>Tashkumyrodon</em> was a small, extinct mammaliaform that lived during the Middle Jurassic, around 165 million years ago. 
Its fossils were found near the town of Tash-Komur too. 
The genus name comes from this town, while the species name, <em>desideratus</em>, refers to its uniqueness as a member of the early mammal lineage. <br>

This animal belonged to a group called docodonts, which are distant relatives of modern mammals. 
<em>Docodonts</em> are particularly interesting because their teeth were highly specialized, with cusps and grooves that allowed them to chew food 
efficiently, unlike most reptiles of their time. 
Even though <em>Tashkumyrodon</em> is known from just a single tooth, this small fossil provides important clues about how early mammal-like creatures 
lived, ate, and evolved. 
Most early mammal fossils are teeth or jaw fragments due to the durability of enamel. 
<br>

During the Jurassic, small creatures like <em>Tashkumyrodon</em> would have shared their environment with dinosaurs, pterosaurs, turtles, 
amphibians, and fish. 
Their tiny size and delicate bones meant they rarely survived as complete skeletons, making isolated teeth like this one extremely valuable 
for paleontologists. 
Today, the holotype tooth of <em>Tashkumyrodon desideratus</em> is carefully preserved in the Zoological Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences 
in St. Petersburg, Russia, serving as a key reference for studying early mammals.   <br>

<br>
<em>Alpkarakush kyrgyzicus</em> is a newly discovered carnivorous dinosaur from the Middle Jurassic, making it the first well-documented 
Jurassic predator from Kyrgyzstan. 
Its fossils were first found in 2006 by Kyrgyz paleontologist Aizek Bakirov near the town of Tash-Komur too. 
Excavations over the following years uncovered parts of two individuals: a larger subadult and a smaller juvenile. <br>

<em>Alpkarakush kyrgyzicus</em> belongs to a group of large predatory dinosaurs called <em>Metriacanthosaurids</em>, known for their tall, 
curved skulls and long spines along their backs. 
It looked somewhat like similar dinosaurs from China, such as <em>Sinraptor</em>, but had several features that made it unique:
<ul>
	<li>A pronounced ridge above the eye, almost like a small horn.</li>
	<li>Hollow spaces in the vertebrae of its back, which may have helped lighten its skeleton.</li>
	<li>A distinct groove on one of its hand bones. </li>
	<li>Special features on the thigh bone, including a deep groove and a ridge offset from the end of the bone.</li>
</ul>

This dinosaur grew to about 7–8 meters long, and the presence of both subadult and juvenile suggests they may have traveled in groups. 
It had a prominent ridge above its eye, special openings in its back vertebrae, and unique features in its leg and hand bones. <br>
The name <em>Alpkarakush</em> comes from a mythical bird in the Kyrgyz epic Manas, while <em>kyrgyzicus</em> honors the country of discovery. 
This find not only adds to our knowledge of dinosaurs in Central Asia but also connects science with Kyrgyz cultural heritage. 
There are plans to display a reconstructed skeleton in a national museum. <br>

<strong><em>Ferganoceratodus</em></strong> (<em>Ferganoceratodus jurassicus</em>) <br>

<br>
<em>Ferganoceratodus jurassicus</em> was a freshwater lungfish that swam in rivers and lakes of Central Asia about 165 million years ago. 
Unlike dinosaurs, lungfish are closely related to the first animals that moved from water to land, making them important for understanding one 
of the most dramatic steps in vertebrate evolution. <br>

The genus <em>Ferganoceratodus</em> was first described in 1985 by Soviet paleontologists Lev Nessov and Mikhail Kaznyshkin. 
They named it after the <a href="kyrgyzstan_2024.html#fergana_valley">Fergana Valley</a>, a broad region near where the Balabansai Formation outcrops, 
rather than the specific site where the fossil was found, as a way to honor the wider area where these ancient fish once lived—a common 
practice in paleontology. <br>

Fossils of <em>Ferganoceratodus</em> include tooth plates and pieces of the skull, which show unique features: 
the upper plates had five ridges, while the lower had four, separated by deep grooves. <br>
These adaptations suggest it was well-equipped for crushing food, likely feeding on small invertebrates or plant matter in rivers and lakes. <br>

Although first discovered in Kyrgyzstan, other species of <em>Ferganoceratodus</em> have been found elsewhere: for example, 
<em>Ferganoceratodus annekempae</em> in <a href="../../country/thailand.html">Thailand</a> and 
<em>Ferganoceratodus edwardsi</em> in <a href="../../country/zimbabwe.html">Zimbabwe</a>.  <br>
This shows that the genus was widespread across the ancient supercontinent of Pangea and survived for tens of millions of years. <br>

Lungfish like <em>Ferganoceratodus</em> are also scientifically fascinating because they represent a living link to the first 
four-limbed vertebrates. 
By studying these fossils, scientists can better understand how life transitioned from water to land, one of the most important events 
in Earth’s history. <br>

<strong><em>Kokartus</em></strong> (<em>Kokartus honorarius</em>) <br>

<br>
<em>Kokartus</em> is an extinct genus of prehistoric stem-group salamander (Caudata) from the Middle Jurassic, 
around 165 million years ago, Balabansai Formation of Kyrgyzstan, was depicted on the First-Day-of-Issue Postmark. 
To date the genus contains only one species <em>Kokartus honorarius</em>, described by the Soviet paleontologist Lev Nessov in 1988 
on the basis of fragmentary specimens. <br>

<br>

<em>Kokartus honorarius</em> is among the oldest and most basal salamanders known in the fossil record and lived at a time when 
<a href="#alpkarakush">dinosaurs dominated terrestrial ecosystems</a>. 
Its remains were found in sediments representing a coastal environment along the northern shore of the Tethys Ocean, 
a region that has yielded important fossils of Jurassic freshwater animals. 
Although very small, estimated at only 8 to 12 cm in total length, <em>Kokartus</em> is scientifically significant because it preserves 
an early stage in salamander evolution, combining primitive amphibian characteristics with features seen in modern species. 
These fossils provide valuable insight into how modern salamanders evolved and how early amphibians lived in Jurassic freshwater environments. <br>
