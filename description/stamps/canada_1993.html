<br>
On October 1<sup>st</sup> 1993, Canadian Post issued the set 
"Prehistoric Life in Canada III, The Age of Dinosaurs" - 
the third four stamps in a four-year series on "Prehistoric Life in Canada".
The series is chronological and covers an interval of time from 1900 million 
to 10,000 years ago. <br>

The earlier sets were denominated at <a href="canada_1990.html">39 cents (1990)</a> and 
<a href="canada_1991.html">40 cents (1991)</a>. 
The 1993 set was denominated at 43 cents per stamp. <br>


<a href="canada_1990.html">The first four stamps in this series</a> were issued as 39-cent denominations 
on July 12, 1990. <br>
A key element in the design is the rendition of the texture of the 
creature's surface, which is produced by a mezzotint stipple effect. 
Although  the colour of these beasts is subject to speculation, each is shown of a hue 
appropriate to its surroundings.<br>

<br>
1993 was the year of world premiere of the famous "Jurassic Park" movie.
On June 11, 1993, the film was released in the US, then in the rest of the world.
The was the first time when the general public could see very realistic 
reconstructions of dinosaurs and other prehistoric reptiles.
As result of a big success of the "Jurassic Park" movie, people everywhere 
were re-discovering a fascination with the "Age of Reptiles", a period in which the 
dinosaur was the dominant land creature. <br>
Canada Post Corporation contributed to this phenomena with its issue of four stamps 
featuring three dinosaurs and one marine reptile.
The same day, two other commonwealth countries, 
<a href="australia_1993.html">Australia</a> and 
<a href="new_zealand_1993.html">New Zealand</a> issued their stamp sets with dinosaurs 
and other prehistoric lizards indigenous to their country. <br>


<br>
The dinosaurs had 165 million years of domination of the earth from approximately 230 million to 65 million 
years ago. 
One theory of why the great beasts became extinct is because they could not adjust to drastic climatic 
changes brought about by a giant asteroid striking the Earth. 
Remains of dinosaurs have been found on all continents, with the first Canadian discovery 
being made at Morgan Creek, Saskatchewan in 1874 by geologists of Her Majesty's 
North American Boundary Commission. 
The famous "badlands" of Alberta yielded the most dinosaur finds in Canada to date. 


The choice of subjects was made on the advice of Canadian paleontologists and 
reflects importance, location in Canada, and visual suitability for depiction on stamps. <br>

<ul>
  <li>
    <a name="massospondylus"></a>
    <strong><em>Massospondylus</em></strong> - lived during the Jurassic period 205 million years ago and is the 
    only known dinosaur to have lived in eastern Canada, in the Bay of Fundy area in Nova Scotia.
    Adults were between three to five meters in length, weighed about 200 kilograms and 
    were herbivores feeding off foliage while standing on their powerful hind legs. 
    When these small dinosaurs roamed the Bay of Fundy area, the landscape was much different than 
    today's and there was one gigantic super continent "Pangea".
    The climate was semi-arid, sand dunes covered the valleys, and the Atlantic Ocean had not yet 
    been formed. 

  </li>

  <li style="margin-top: 10px;">
    <a name="albertosaurus"></a>
    The <strong><em>Albertosaurus</em></strong> were Cretaceous-period flesh-eating 
    dinosaurs belonging to the family Tyrannosauridae. 
    Slightly smaller than their better known cousin, the <em>Tyrannosaurus</em>, they were powerful 
    beasts which probably tore huge pieces of flesh from their living prey. 
    These dinosaurs had large heads, wart-like bony growths on the bridge of the nose, long teeth, and 
    foot claws which were more hoof-like than sickle-shaped. 
    They weighed approximately two and a half metric tonnes with a length of about 10 meters. 
    They inhabited the flood plains and deltas which separated the Rocky Mountains from the coastline of 
    the interior seaway to the east and existed between 83 and 65 million years ago. <br>
    <a href="canada_1989.html">The first fossil (skull) of <em>Albertosaurus</em></a> was discovered 
    by Canadian geologist, cartographer, and mining consultant Joseph Burr Tyrrell in August 1884, 
    near Drumheller.
  </li>

  <li style="margin-top: 10px;">
    <a name="styracosaurus"></a>
    The third and heaviest dinosaur in this stamp set, the Cretaceous-period 
    <strong><em>Styracosaurus</em></strong>, 
    is generally known for its rhino-like horn and the unusually long spines in its frill. 
    A huge creature, midway in size between a bull hippo and a bull elephant, it weighed about 
    4 metric tonnes and measured 5 meters in length. 
    Males and females had different spines, and the <em>Styracosaurus</em> featured on the stamp 
    displays the long backward pointing spines believed to denote a male specimen. 
    Females, it is thought, had spines curving forward. 
    Specimens of this dinosaur have been found in Alberta and Montana where they roamed about 76 million 
    years ago. 
    The Alberta species differs from that found in Montana in that it has a greater number of frill spines.
  </li>

  <li style="margin-top: 10px;">
    <a name="platecarpus"></a>
    <strong><em>Platecarpus</em></strong>  was a six-meter long Cretaceous-period marine reptile which 
    represents something of a cross between a lizard and a seal. 
    The most common of the mosasaurs, <em>Platecarpus</em> descended from land lizards and had limbs 
    that were modified into paddle-like flippers, with a vertically expanded, eel-like tail. 
    Savage and pugnacious in nature, they fed on fish and were in turn attacked by sharks.
    <em>Platecarpus</em> inhabited the North American mid-continental seaway, which 85 million years ago 
    extended from Texas to the Arctic Ocean. 
    In Canada, remains of <em>Platecarpus</em> have been discovered in the District of Mackenzie, 
    Northwest Territories and near Morden, Manitoba. 
    They have also been identified from Alabama to Europe to southern Africa. 
    The group to which it belonged, mosasaurus, became extinct at the about same time as dinosaurs 
    vanished from the face of the Earth.
