On April 22<sup>nd</sup>, 1998, the Post of Singapore issued three self-adhesive stamps depicting dinosaurs. <br>
These stamps, without face values,  were valid for local mail (as inscribed on the top side of every stamp) 
up to 20gr. or for part payment for postage on heavier items. <br>
These stamps could not be used on overseas mail.
It seems, however, after several years, the rule was recalled - see some <a href="#covers">cover examples</a> with these stamps sent 
to Germany in 2012. 
<br>

<p>
	At the beginning, the sheet of 15 stamps was sold by Singapore Post's philatelic bureaus as well as
	 via OCBC (Oversea Chinese Banking Corporation) ATMs.<br>
	The sheet was designed with exactly the same dimensions as the currency note of SGD 50  (156mm x 74mm x 0.13mms),
	so that they can be issued through the same aperture. 
	(New notes with  different dimensions were issued in 1999). <br>
	<em>These stamps are the thinnest stamps related to Paleontology.</em> <br>
	Later on the sale through ATM machine was abandoned, due to frequent jamming of these sheetlets 
	and the stamps were offered to collectors in the philatelic bureau only. <br>
	During that period, <a href="#sheets">two different designs of the reverse side</a> 
	of the sheet were issued (the brown one is less common). <br>
	<br>
	<!-- 
	There were only 2 such issues, the other wasthe  Palm Tree issued in 1993. 
	They were issued through arrangement by the bank with Singapore Post.
	-->
	The First Day Cover (FDC) was on sale at select Singapore Post's philatelic bureaus only, 
	since the date of the stamps issue.

<br>
Dinosaurs are probably the best-known prehistoric life. <sup><a href="#N1">[Note]</a></sup> <br>
Their dynasty started 230 million years ago, in the Mesozoic Era, from the Late
Triassic until the end of Cretaceous, a total of 165 million years. <br>
<br>
Two groups of dinosaurs existed, the Saurischian (or lizard-hipped dinosaurs) and 
the Ornithischian (or bird-hipped dinosaurs) and they can be plant or meat-eaters.  <br>
Many myths and legends have been told about the dinosaurs.  
Some are based on facts, others no more than guess work.  <br>
The three dinosaurs featured here are from different family groups and lived in different periods.  <br>
Fossil finds show that all lived in North America during the Mesozoic.<br>

			<td>The <strong><em>Pentaceratops</em></strong>
				("five horned face") belongs to the family of Ceratopsidae. <br>
				They looked like the rhinoceros and were plant-eaters with huge heads, 
				bulky bodies and heavy limbs and hooflike claws. <br>
				Most had two long brow horns and a short nose horn or vice versa. <br>
				It is believed that Ceratopsians roamed in herds browsing on low-growing vegetation. <br> 
				The four-legged dinosaur existed in the Late Cretaceous period and could grow to 6m long.
			</td>
			<td>The <strong><em>Apatosaurus</em></strong>
				("deceptive lizard"), was from the family of Diplodocidae.  <br>
				The Diplodocids stood highest at the hips, bearing weight upon their elephantine 
				limbs with short broad "hands" and feet.  <br>
				The <em>Apatosaurus</em> were plant-eaters which existed in the Late Jurassic
				period and were very large with long whiplash tail and long neck.  <br>
				It was one of the longest dinosaurs with small heads, sloping with eyes
				far back and peg-like teeth only at the front of the jaws for cutting soft leaves.  <br>
				It was huge and could grow up to 21m long, 4.5m high at	the shoulder and weighed more than 20,000 kg.
			</td>
			<td>The <strong><em>Albertosaurus</em></strong>
				("Alberta lizards") was related to the <em>Tyrannosaurus</em> (or T-rex) featured in the movies.  <br>
				It came from the family of Tyrannosauridae (tyrant lizards) which had a huge head, with
				semi-forwarding facing eyes in some long, curved and, saw-edged fangs
				in jaws big enough to swallow animals as big as humans.  <br>
				They were fierce predatory animal that ran fast and they would lunge with their
				heads to take "scoop bites" from their victim's bodies.  <br>
				<em>Albertosaurus</em> existed in the Late Cretaceous 
				period and could grow up to 8m long and probably weighed over 2,000 kg.</td>

		The Ornithischian dinosaurs are thought to only be herbivores (plant-eaters). <br>
		The Theropods  were mostly carnivores – but there are a few interesting groups from the Cretaceous 
		that may have been omnivores or herbivores. <br>
		The Saurischians were mixed. 
		Some of the early prosauropods were likely omnivores and a few have even been interpreted as carnivores. 
		Their larger relatives – the apatosaurus/brachiosaurus, etc. were definitely herbivores.
