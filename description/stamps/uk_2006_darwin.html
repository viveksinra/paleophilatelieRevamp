The National Portrait Gallery houses an immense collection of portraits
featuring some of Britain's most significant subjects. With 9,000
portraits of famous men and women and boasting a phenomenal archive,
library and technology gallery the NPG acts as a pictorial "Who is Who"
of British history. The images selected for the stamps are drawn from a
full historical time span, and show a balance of people from different
areas of life including a politician, a writer and an artist. The
stamps also show the wide variety of different media that are exhibited
in the gallery such as portraits in sculpture, watercolour, oil
painting and photography. Royal Mail's design team worked closely with
the NPG to establish a final shortlist which was passed on to designer
Peter Willberg, who has previously worked on the 2005 Jane Eyre issue
featuring Paula Rego-s haunting lithographs. Included in the stamp
issue is the most famous image of William Shakespeare, which has a
special significance as it was the first portrait the Gallery acquired.
Also featured are less well known images, such as the charming portrait
of Marry Anne Seacole and the rare oil painting of Emmeline Pankhurst.
To keep the labelling as simple and uncluttered as possible, the stamp
features the name of the subject and the name of the gallery.

<a href="../../images/details/stamps/official/uk/2006/darwin/charles_darwin_portrait_2006.jpg"><img style="border: 0px solid ; width: 89px; height: 121px; float: left;" alt="Charles Darwin on stamp of UK 2006" title="Charles Darwin on stamp of UK 2006" src="../../images/details/stamps/official/uk/2006/darwin/preview/uk_2006_10.gif" hspace="6"></a>
Charles Robert Darwin (1809-1882), <span style="font-weight: bold;">naturalist,
geologist and originator of the theory of evolution</span>.
Sitter in 30 portraits.<br>
This portrait of Charles Darwin, the great scientist and author of On
the Origin of Species, is a copy by the artist of a portrait undertaken
by John Collier for the Linnaean Society. Collier was himself the
son-in-law of another prominent late Victorian scientist, Thomas Henry
Huxley. The portrait was presented to the Gallery by Darwin's eldest
son, William Erasmus Darwin, who wrote to Lionel Cust in 1896: 'The
picture is a replica of the one in the rooms in the Linnaean Society
and was made by Collier after the original. I took some trouble about
it and as a likeness it is an improvement on the original.' It shows
Darwin as an old man in the year before his death. According to
Darwin's third son, Francis, 'The portrait represents him standing
facing the observer in the loose cloak so familiar to those who knew
him and with his slouch hat in his hand. Many of those who knew his
face most intimately, think that Mr Collier's picture is the best of
the portraits and in this judgement the sitter himself was inclined to
agree.' </td>

Class - Sir Winston Churchill</strong><br>
Without doubt one of the most significant figures of the 20th century,
this portrait of Sir Winston Churchill perfectly captures his grim
determination. Secker-s painting of the great Prime Minister wreathed
in smoke was apparently not liked by the man himself, although perhaps
this was because it was too close to the truth, as the portrait was
well known for its similarity to the sitter.</td>

Class - Sir Joshua Reynolds</strong><br>
It is most fitting that this portrait of Sir Joshua Reynolds be
included as he was the first President of the Royal Academy, and his
annual -Discourses- to the students remain an important component in
the teaching of artistic history. Reynolds was more responsible than
any other for raising the status of artists in Britain.</td>

Class - TS Eliot</strong> Heron's semi-Cubist portrait of Eliot
is both stylistically innovative and intellectually demanding, much
like the author himself. Elliot is known for classic works such as The
Waste Land, The Cocktail Party and Old Possum-s book of Practical Cats,
a book of light verse, which was the basis of the Musical show Cats. </td>

Founder of the Women-s Social and Political Union with her daughter
Christabel, Emmeline Pankhurst was the leader of the militant movement
for women-s suffrage. She was imprisoned for her beliefs and actions on
several occasions, as was the portrait-s painter, Georgina Agnes
Brackenbury, who was also involved in militant suffrage activity.</td>

this was taken in 1902, just as she was embarking on her career. It is
unusual as she was normally averse to sitting for portraits and being
pictured. The photo shows her looking pale and contemplative.</td>

Class - Sir Walter Scott </strong> This bust of Sir Walter Scott
was the result of several sittings by the renowned novelist and poet
for the sculptor, Sir Francis Leggatt Chantrey. The sittings were
appropriately social occasions which always included breakfast, and
when it was finished Chantrey presented Scott with the marble as a
token of his respect and friendship. </td>

The most recent painting in the set, Dame Cicely sat for this portrait
over 22 times, many of which were during her struggle with cancer. As
founder of the hospice movement her contribution is without doubt, and
she is a modern addition to this collection of our country-s most
significant faces. </td>
