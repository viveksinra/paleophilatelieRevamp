On November 24<sup>th</sup>, 2009, the Marshall Islands Postal Service issued
the set with five stamps showing Cenozoic's mammals.
The stamps were printed in a sheet of four strips.<br>

Between 1989 and 2018 the Marshall Islands outsource the production of their 
stamps to the USA-based company, Unicover Corporation (discontinued in 2018).

<p class="notes">
	Unicover Corporation was privately owned, they have had a wide-reaching artwork 
	originals business. 
	Their principal subsidiary, Unicover World Trade Corporation, was markets postage 
	stamps in North America for various postal administrations from around the globe. <br>
	One of the subsidiary companies of Unicover was Fleetwood (acquired by Mystic in 2007).
	Fleetwood was FDC maker company, since 1929, who create unique cachets for their covers, 
	based on the artwork collection of Unicover Corporation.
</p>

<br>
The artwork for these stamps were created in 1995, by Done Balke,
for cachets of the Fleetwood's FDC with "<a href="usa_1996.html">Prehistoric Animals</a>" 
stamps of USA, issued in 1996. <br>

<br>
Towards the end of the Mesozoic Era about 65 million years ago, changes began to take place 
on Earth, resulting in the growth of mountain ranges and a colder and more arid climate. 
Swamplands and shallow oceans dried up, hastening the extinction of many reptilian species. 
These  geological and atmospheric changes prepared the way for the next age of history: <br> 
the <strong>Cenozoic Era</strong>, also known as <strong>the Age of Mammals</strong>. <br>
During this Era, ancestors of present-day mammals including early elephants, horses and camels 
were originated. 
Carnivores proliferated and evolved into canine and feline types of animals. 
While some creatures adapted very well to the changing environment, others could 
not tolerate the new conditions and migrated to more temperate areas. 
Those that could not adapt eventually became extinct. <br>



<!--- Mastodon -->
<a name="mastodon"></a>
<br>
Evidence reveals that the <strong>mastodons</strong> date back 40 million years. <br>
Originating in North Africa, they eventually migrated to Asia, Europe and the rest of Africa. 
Some 25 million years later, these creatures crossed the Bering Strait to North America. 
Mastodons became extinct approximately 8,000 years ago. <br>

Scientists speculate that this was due to the depletion of the large creature's food source. 
An herbivore, mastodons fed on twigs and leaves which they ground up with their massive teeth measuring 
three inches wide and six inches long. 
Deeply rooted, these teeth were covered in hard enamel. <br>
Early male mastodons had two sets of tusks, one attached to the bottom jaw and one to the top. 
The lower tusks were short and straight in contrast to the long and curved upper tusks. 
Later, due to evolutionary adaptations, the lower tusks disappeared. <br>
Well-preserved remains of mastodons have been found all over North and South America. 

<p class="notes">
	Mastodon is not a genus, but the colloquial name for members of the family <em>Gomphotheriidae</em>. 
	The depicted genus is probably Mammut. <br>
	The first Mastodon discovered in the North America was the mastodon discovered in 1799. <br>
	Some of its bones were depicted on USA's stamp 
	"<a href="usa_1955.html">150<sup>th</sup> Anniversary of the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts"</a>  
	in 1955. This stamp is the 
	<a href="../../milestones.html#bones">first stamp with a bones, skeleton of prehistoric animal</a>.
</p>

Interestingly, some mastodons found in the polar ice caps have been preserved almost intact. 
These particular remains have revealed that mastodons were covered in thick reddish-brown, woolly fur. 
Though these animals were similar to the modern elephant, there are some notable differences. 
For example, mastodons had flatter heads and larger tusks. 
In addition, their bodies were stockier and they stood slightly shorter than today's elephants.
<br>

<!--- Eohippus / Hyracotherium -->
<a name="eohippus"></a>
<br>
An early ancestor of the modern-day horse, <strong><em>Eohippus</em></strong>, also known as "dawn horse" or <em>Hyracotherium</em>, 
existed about 65 million years ago in what is now North America and Europe. <br>

The fossil record reveals that these animals lived during the Ice Age and eventually inhabited every 
continent except <a href="../../country/australia.html">Australia</a>. <br>
Large herds of prehistoric horses were believed to have roamed throughout North and South America, 
yet scientists can't explain why the early horse disappeared from the Americas between 8,000 to 10,000 years ago. <br>
<em>Eohippus</em> was a small, fox-like animal with an arched back. 
Standing about 10 to 20 inches (25cm to 50cm) high, these early horses had four toes on their 
front feet and three on their hind feet. 
Each toe ended in a separate small hoof. 
Large pads, similar to those of dogs, kept the toes off the ground and bore the animal's weight. <br>
As the horse evolved, it became taller and its legs more slender. 
The center toes lengthened and became stronger. <br>
Though early man hunted horses for food, these animals were not domesticated until long after dogs and cattle. 
There is no evidence of when man first tamed horses and trained them for riding. 
However, in the ancient city of Susa in southwestern Asia there is documentation that man rode horseback 
more than 5,000 years ago. <br>
It is believed that today's domestic horse breeds emerged from three types of an early horse: 
Przewalski's horse of central Asia, the tarpan found in south-eastern Europe and the forest horse of northern Europe.
<br>

<!--- Woolly Mammoth -->
<a name="mammoth"></a>
<br>
Ancestor of the present-day elephant, the <strong>mammoth</strong> originally inhabited the temperate 
climate of the northern hemisphere during the glacial period.  <br>

Eventually it journeyed further north where it survived until the Neolithic Period. <br>
It is believed that these huge prehistoric beasts prospered during post-glacial times 
when northern Asia was covered with pine forests, supplying the mammoth with an abundance of vegetation. <br>
Due to slow climatic changes, these forests disappeared and may be one of the reasons for the mammoth's extinction. 
Mammoth fossils are quite common throughout northern Europe, North America and Asia. <br>
The ivory of this magnificent beast was so abundant that during the Middle Ages it was exported 
from Siberia to <a href="../../country/china.html">China</a> and Europe. <br>
In 1799, <a href="russia_2020.html#mammoth_discovery">the first intact mammoth carcass was discovered</a>. 
Frozen into icy cliffs along the Arctic coast of Siberia, this find enabled paleontologists to successfully 
reconstruct the mammoth's form and features. 
In 1801, another discovery was made in Siberia in which a complete skeleton - including entire mammoth tusks 
still in their sockets - had been preserved in the ice. <br>
This specimen exhibited thick skin covered with dark, dense woolly fur, and tusks that measured over nine feet in length. 
Mammoth tusks are distinct from present-day elephant tusks in that they display a vast outward and upward sweep. 
The largest mammoth tusks on record were found in Alaska and measure nearly 13 feet (4 meter) long.
<br>


<!--- Saber-tooth Cat -->
<a name="saber-toothed_cat"></a>
<br>
A formidable predator, the <strong>saber-toothed cat</strong> existed during the Oligocene Period, some 40 million years ago. 
It roamed the continents of Europe, Asia, Africa, North America and South America. <br> 

<table align="right" width="200px"   style="margin-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px" >

	</tr>
</table>

<p class="notes">
	One of the most famous saber-toothed cats lived in North and South Americas was 
	<em>Smilodon</em>. <br>
	<em>Smilodon</em> lived in the Americas during the Pleistocene Epoch 
	(2.5 million years ago – 10,000 years ago). 
	The genus was named in 1842 based on fossils from Brazil; the generic name means 
	"scalpel" or "two-edged knife" combined with "tooth". 
	The hundreds of specimens obtained from 
	<a href="../../milestones.html#ps1">the La Brea Tar Pits in Los Angeles</a>  
	constitute the largest collection of Smilodon fossils.
</p>

Possessing a muscular neck, powerful front legs, a sloping back and a lynx-like tail, 
the saber-toothed cat was similar to many cats of the era. <br> 
Yet this creature was distinguished by sharp, eight-inch-long, canine teeth resembling curved sabers. 
It was also equipped with huge jaws capable of opening to a 90 degree angle, making it easier to attack large prey. <br>
The saber-toothed cat feasted on thick-skinned animals such as the <a href="../../topics/paleo/vertebrate/mammoth.html">woolly mammoth</a>, 
mastodon and ground sloth. <br>
Often compared to modern lions and tigers because of its predatory habits and its size, this creature 
is also referred to as the "saber-toothed tiger" and "saber-toothed lion." <br>
Scientifically, these names are not accurate, as the saber-toothed cat is a true cat, a member of the felid family <em>Felidae</em>, 
while lions and tigers are members of sub-families of felids. <br>
Around 8,000 years ago, the saber-toothed cat became extinct. 
An early theory about this phenomenon stated that the big cat's prominent teeth grew so large its bite eventually 
became ineffective for hunting and eating. 
However, scientists now believe that as the prey of the saber-toothed cat began to die out, the loss of its primary food 
source in turn led to the creature's own demise.
