He published numerous geological scientific papers, quite outstanding 
at the time, which have, for decades, served as starting points for further 
fundamental and practical researches  of Croatia and western 
<a href="../../country/bosnia_herzegovina.html">Bosnia</a>. <br>
He was  engaged in many geological disciplines: <strong>paleontology</strong>, mineralogy, petrology, 
coal deposits, geodynamics and hydrogeology of Karst. <br>
He was also engaged in  studies regarding mining, mining law, geodesy, astronomy, meteorology and 
archeology. <br>
He also participated in the founding of the Croatian National Science Association, 
the Croatia Mountaineering Association and, in 1885/6, together with some friends, he founded 
and registered the first chess club in  Zagreb; he also organized a "trial tournament", the first 
modern Croatian chess  tournament based on the model of European chess contests.<br>

<strong>Ante Sercer</strong> was born in Slavonska Pozega in 1896.  <br>
He attended grammar school in Dubrovnik and completed his medical studies in Graz and Prague. 
He specialized in otolaryngology in Zagreb and later in Prague and Vienna.  <br>
He started working on the Medical Faculty of the Otolaryngologic Clinical Hospital in 
Zagreb in 1920. 
Later he became its administrator and soon  also associate professor.  <br>
In 1946, he became head of the department of the otolaryngologic department of the Sisters of Mercy 
Hospital.  <br>
Owing to his reputation the department was given the status of the otolaryngological clinical 
hospital of the Medical faculty in 1964.  <br>
Sercer published 170 scientific papers, among which include important works in the field  
of otolaryngological propaedeutics and clinical treatment, plastic surgery of the 
nose and ear, oral surgery and tonsilar problems.  <br>
He experimentally tested and proved that the nose is not simply a passive tube serving for the passage of 
air, but an active and complex respiratory organ.  <br>
His method of presenting the infrastructure of the nose through decortication attracted great attention abroad. 
He was among the first in Europe to treat otosclerosis by surgery and he also worked out a special theory 
about the etiopathogenesis of this  illness. <br>

<strong>Frane Bulic</strong> was born in Vranjic near Split in 1846.  <br>
He studied theology in Zadar, was ordained as priest in 1869 and in the same year started the study 
of classical philology and Slavonic studies in Vienna.  <br>
Afterwards he also studied classical archeology. 
He actively worked as a researcher, preservationist and writer of numerous scientific and expert works. 
He acquired his scientific experience on the archeological sites in Greece, Asia Minor, Egypt and Syria, 
working together with the eminent European archaeologists of that time.  <br> 
He undertook research of ancient and Old-Christian monuments of ancient Salona and discovered several 
hundreds of epigraphs as well as the Old-Christian graveyard in Vranjic.  <br>
In 1891 he discovered a stone with an inscription of Prince Trpimir in Rizinice near Solin, 
and later also discovered the ruins of the monastery and church of the Benedictines whom Trpimir invited 
to Croatia.  <br>
In Bijaci near Trogir he found the foundations of Trpimir's church that was dedicated to St. Martha 
and then in Majdan near Solin. 
He found the graveyard dating from the times of the Croatian national dynasty.  <br>
Of particular importance is his research on the island on the river in Solin, Otok, where he discovered 
the sarcophagus of the Croatian queen Jelena from the year 976. <br>
