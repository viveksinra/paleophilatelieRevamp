Two stamps depicting dinosaurs issued by Post Authority of Benin in 1984, show outdated scientific 
reconstructions of both <em>Anatosaurus</em> and <em>Brintosaurus</em>,
<a href="../../topics/paleo/contributors.html#burian">based on an illustration done by famous Czech  
artist Zdenek Burian</a>.
<br>

The design of one of the stamps is based on a painting by Zdenek Burian titled 
"<em>Trachodon</em> and <em>Tyrannosaurus</em>" painted in 1938. 
The painting was used as an illustration in a vintage book, "Prehistoric Animals" published in 1956. <br>

The <strong><em>Anatosaurus</em></strong> or "Duck Lizard" was one of the last large dinosaurs to roam the earth.
It flourished during the Late Cretaceous Epoch - about one hundred million years ago. 
It was a graceful animal which walked on two feet and ran rapidly with its long flattened tail outstretched. 
Its body was covered with a leathery skin similar to a Gilla monster's. <br>


A mature <em>Anatosaurus</em> stood fourteen feet tall and weighed three to four tons. 
It had long powerful legs and large three-toed feet; its forelimbs were slender and had four-fingered 
webbed hands. Its broad, spoon-bill beak was lined with prism-shaped teeth arranged in alternating rows 
along its upper and lower jaws. 
<em>Anatosaurus</em> was primarily a vegetarian who enjoyed browsing on shrubs and conifers along lush 
tropical riverbanks. <br>
Like giraffes, they probably stripped leaves and shoots from branches when feeding. 
Its large eyes and high, deep nostrils allowed it to quickly sense impending danger. 
To avoid the huge carnivores like <em>Tyrannosaurus</em>, it probably depended upon its keen senses and 
speed, but its crocodile-like tail made it a proficient swimmer too. 
Sixty-five million years ago the Age of Dinosaurs ended in a global catastrophe.
Today only fossil evidence remains of <em>Anatosaurus</em>. 
Complete fossils of <em>Anatosaurus</em> have been uncovered in the Lance Formation of Wyoming.
<br>


		

<br>
Like the other stamp in this issue, the <strong><em>Brontosaurus</em></strong> stamp was also 
based on a painting by Zdenek Burian. 
This painting was completed in 1950 and was also used as an illustration in the vintage book 
"Prehistoric Animals" published in 1956. <br>

Though it was an herbivore, the <em>Brontosaurus</em> numbers among the largest land animals that ever lived. 
It was so large, in fact, there has been some debate as to whether such an enormous beast could support 
its great bulk on land or was forced to dwell almost exclusively in water. 
While it is most likely the creature spent a lot of time in the water to help support its tremendous weight,
and also took refuge from predators by retreating into the water, scientists now believe that 
<em>Brontosaurus</em> was able to get around on land with relative grace. 
However, it probably represents the maximum size and bulk attainable by a land animal. 
This huge swamp-dweller stood on four huge, elephant-like legs, and had a long neck and tail. 
However, its tiny head took up only about two feet of its eighty-foot length.
The size, shape and features of brontosaurus' head were disputed by scientists for more than a century 
after the first remains were uncovered. 
Incomplete finds, and the possibility of a mix-up of fossils in transit from an excavation site created great 
uncertainty, and the head was represented in early models as snub-nosed; the teeth, spoon-like. 
In 1978, however, scientists rejected this representation in favor of a slender, elongated skull containing long, 
sharp teeth.
These teeth may have looked dangerous, but they were really rather delicate and probably only suitable for 
eating the most tender plants.</p>
