<strong>Ukraine</strong>, is a sovereign state in Eastern Europe, has an area of 603,628 km2 and a
population of about 42.5 million. <br>

Ukraine is the largest country entirely within Europe. 
It's about the same size as 
<a href="germany.html">Germany</a>, 
<a href="austria.html">Austria</a>, 
<a href="switzerland.html">Switzerland</a>, 
<a href="portugal.html">Portugal</a> and 
<a href="belgium.html">Belgium</a> combined. <br>
The geographical center of Europe is in western Ukraine – close to the village of Dilove. 
 claim made by geographers in 1886 using the technology of the day. <br>
<br>
The territory of modern Ukraine has been inhabited since 32,000 BC. 
During the Middle Ages, the area was a key centre of East Slavic culture, with the powerful state of Kievan
Rus forming the basis of Ukrainian identity.<br> 
Following its fragmentation in the 13<sup>th</sup> century, the territory was contested, ruled
and divided by a variety of powers, including 
<a href="lithuania.html">Lithuania</a>, 
<a href="poland.html">Poland</a>, the Ottoman Empire, 
<a href="austria.html">Austria</a>-<a href="hungary.html">Hungary</a> and 
<a href="russia.html">Russia</a>. <br>
A Cossack republic emerged and prospered during the 17<sup>th</sup> and 18<sup>th</sup>  
centuries, but its territory was eventually split between Poland and the Russian Empire 
and later merged fully into Russia. <br>
Two brief periods of independence occurred during the 20<sup>th</sup> century, 
once near the end of World War I and another during World War II. <br>
However, both occasions would ultimately see Ukraine's territories consolidated into a Soviet republic, 
a situation that persisted until 1991, when Ukraine gained its independence from the 
<a href="ussr.html">Soviet Union</a> in the aftermath of its dissolution at the end of the Cold War. <br>
Before its independence, Ukraine was typically referred to in English as "The Ukraine", 
but sources since then have moved to drop "the" from the name of Ukraine in all uses.

<br>				
<a name="philately"></a> In 1918 an independent Ukrainian People's Republic was established and a 
series of five definitive stamps were issued. <br>
Ukraine used the stamps of the Soviet Union from 1919 until the end of 1991, apart from during
World War II. <br>
<!-- 
July 16, 1990 the Supreme Soviet of the Ukrainian SSR adopted the Declaration of State Sovereignty of Ukraine. <br>
Kiev artist Alexander Ivachnenko received from the Ministry of Communications of the USSR order for a stamp dedicated to the event. 
He offered some sketches that were discussed in the Ministry of Communications of the USSR and the Supreme Council of the Republic. 
On one of the first choices girl symbolizing Ukraine, was dressed in a shirt, tunic and barefoot. 
She suggested, "shod" in boots and red skirt instead of "put" Plahty. 
In wreath blue ribbon was added, causing the blue background of the brand changed to gold. 
The inscription on the stamp was "Mail of the USSR", but in the preparation of drawings for
the press, it was changed to the traditional - "Mail of the USSR". 
The Postal stamp went into circulation 10 July 1991. 
-->
After the collapse of the Soviet Union, Ukraine declared its independence and the
first stamps of the new republic were issued on 1 March 1992.  <br>
In 1992 the Ukrainian Post Office overprinted stamps of the Soviet Union with stylised tridents for 
use in Kiev, Lviv and Chernihiv.  <br>
Other Soviet stamps overprinted with similar designs are not believed to have been postally valid. 
Since 1992, a variety of commemorative and definitive stamps have been issued.

<a name="O3"></a> [O3] Mammoth and its bones shown on a cachet and <a href="#PM1">postmark</a> 
of FDC with "Mezyn National Nature Park" stamps set.<br>
<br>
The "<strong>Mezyn National Nature Park</strong>" covers an area of more than 30 thousand hectares. 
The landscape of the park includes many lakes. <br>
Besides the landscape, the park also hosts approximately 50 archaeological monuments. 
The archaeological monuments represent different eras and cultures – including archaeological, architectural 
and historical monuments in the villages of Buzhanka, Kurylivka, Sverdlovka, Radychiv and others.
<br>
The most noted is <strong>Mezyn Paleolithic Camp</strong> that existed almost 20 thousand years ago. <br>

Ukrainian stamps from 2017, “"<a href="../description/stamps/ukraine_2017.html">The Cultural Epochs of Ukraine: Paleolithic Age</a>" 
show reconstructions of this site. 
A reconstruction of a <a href="../topics/paleo/vertebrate/mammoth.html">woolly mammoth</a> is also shown on the <a href="#pm_Mezyn">postmark of the FDC</a>. <br>

<br>
<a name="O4"></a>&nbsp;[O4] New stamp from the multi-year set 
"Beauty and Greatness of Ukraine" was dedicated to the Rivne region 
and shows a piece of amber from the collection of the Amber Museum in Rivne, Ukraine. <br> 
Amber is a fossilized resin of the ancients conifers growing in the area of Rivne region. <br>
The amber is dated between Late Eocene and Early Miocene (about 37-50 million years ago) and suggested to be contemporaneous to Baltic amber. <br>

<a name="PM1"></a> [PM1] The postmark for the FDC of "Mezyn National Nature Park" stamps set is based on the Logo
of Mezyn National Nature Park. <br>
The postmark was issued in two locations: Kyiv (the capital of Ukraine) and Korop (an urban-type settlement - 
<span lang="ua">селище міського типу</span> in Ukranian - or just <span lang="ua">смт</span> as written on the postmark).
Korop is the regional centre, near Mezyn village. <br>
<br>
The park spread over 30.000 hectares, is covered with many lakes and it is a home for many animals and plants. <br>
A museum in Sverdlovka provides information about the Park – including information on the climatic, 
geographic and other features of the park. <br>
It also exhibits collections of insects, mosses, and geologic materials. <br>
<br>
Beside the unique natural complexes and objects the park boasts about 50 archaeological monuments. <br>
The most important is <a  href="../description/stamps/ukraine_2017.html">Mezyn Paleolithic Site</a>. 
Remains of over 100 individual mammoths and many remains of other mammals, are found at the site. <br>
Reconstruction of one of the mammoths is shown on the top-right corner of the Logo and the postmark.
