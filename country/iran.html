<strong>Iran</strong>, officially the Islamic Republic of Iran.
Known as Persia until 1935, Iran became an Islamic republic in 1979 after the ruling monarchy was overthrown and Shah Mohammad Reza PAHLAVI was forced into exile.<br>
Conservative clerical forces led by Ayatollah Ruhollah KHOMEINI established a theocratic system of government with
ultimate political authority vested in a learned religious scholar referred to commonly as the Supreme Leader who,
according to the constitution, is accountable only to the Assembly of Experts.
The country with more than 83 million inhabitants located in Western Asia and
bordered by 
 <a href="armenia.html">Armenia</a>,  
 <a href="azerbaijan.html">Azerbaijan</a>,  
 <a href="turkmenistan.html">Turkmenistan</a>,  
 <a href="afghanistan.html">Afghanistan</a>,  
 Pakistan, Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman, 
 <a href="armenia.html">Turkey</a> and 
 <a href="armenia.html">Iraq</a>. <br>
 Tehran is the capital and largest city, as well as the leading economic and cultural hub.<br>
 Iran is home to one of the world's oldest civilizations, beginning with the formation 
 of the Elamite kingdoms in the fourth millennium BC. <br>
 According to some fossils found in the country, it is suggested that <strong><em>Neanderthals</em></strong> were
 roaming the Iranian Zagros Mountain sometimes between  40 to 70 thousand years ago.
<sup><a href="#r1">[R1]</a></sup>
<br>
<br>
<a name="philately"></a>
The first stamps of Iran issued in 1868 - set of four imperforated stamps with Steamship images.<br>
To date (2020) there are no official stamps of Iran that relate to paleontological and paleoanthropological sciences.<br>
Some personalized stamps with fossils and cave painting of Neanderthals were issued by the National Museum of Teheran 
in  2019  - the only stamps of the country to consider.

<strong>Notes:</strong><br>
<a name="O1"></a> [O1] Abu Rayhan Muhammad ibn Ahmad al-Biruni  (973-1048) commonly known as al-Biruni, was a scholar 
and polymath during the Islamic Golden Age. <br>
al-Biruni was born in the outer district (Bīrūn) of Kath, the capital of the Afrighid dynasty of Khwarezm (Chorasmia) 
in Central Asia - now part of the autonomous republic of Karakalpakstan in the northwest of <a href="uzbekistan.html">Uzbekistan</a>. <br>
He has been called variously the "Founder of Indology", "Father of Comparative Religion", "Father of Modern Geodesy".
Al-Biruni is considered by some to be the first anthropologist as he studied the customs and religions of India. <br>
He expressed an opinion about the possibility of the Earth moving around the Sun and determined the circumference of the Earth. <br>
He may have been the first person to suggest a standard ordering of geologic time with different eras that followed one another. 
In this way, he identified the concept of stratigraphy. <br>
In his work about India, he suggested, based on fossil evidence, that the region had been under sea. 
It was quite innovative thinking. <br>
In Europe, scholars and later scientists believed in an unchanging Earth and recognized fossils as a "game of nature", 
rather than remains of prehistoric animals until the 19<sup>th</sup> century.
<sup><a href="#r4">[R4]</a></sup>
<br>

<br>
<a name="O2"></a> [O2] Ibn Sina, known in the West as Avicenna (980-1037), was a Persian
 polymath who is regarded as one of the most significant physicians, astronomers, thinkers and writers of the Islamic Golden Age 
 and the father of early modern medicine. <br>

 Ibn Sina was born in present-day <a href="uzbekistan.html">Uzbekistan</a>, which at that time was ruled over by a Persian dynasty (the Samanids). <br>

 In 1027 Ibn Sina stated in his "Book of Healing", that fossils are formed when remains of dead animals 
 and plants are turned to stone by a petrifying virtue which seeps from the earth, 
 perhaps during earthquakes or other slower upheavals. <br>
 <p><em>
	“If what is said concerning the petrifaction of animals and plants is true, the cause of this (phenomenon) 
	is a powerful mineralizing and petrifying virtue which arises in certain stony spots, or emanates suddenly 
	from the earth during earthquakes and subsidences, and petrifies whatever comes into contact with it. <br>
	As a matter of fact, the petrifaction of the bodies of plants and animals is not more extraordinary than 
	the transformation of waters.”
</em></p>

At the same time, European scholars stated that fossils were just fancy stones produced as a “game of nature”. 
This explanation was widespread in Europe until the 19<sup>th</sup> century.

<a name="P1"></a> [P1]  The National Museum of Teheran issued a set with a number of personalized 
stamps showing artefacts  of their huge collection in 2019. 
Three stamps are related to the stone age.  
The stamps themselves are ornamental tablets, with big personalized tabs attached to it.

The tabs are:

		src="../images/country/iran/t_iran_2020_1a_presentation.jpg"></a>
	
	
Neanderthal tooth found at <em>Wezmeh cave</em> by a team led by Fereidoun Biglari in 1999. <br>
Fereidoun Biglari is the co-founder and head of the Paleolithic Department in the National Museum of Iran which
was established in 2001. 
The tooth is pictured on one of the stamps in the set and until recently was thought to be from a modern human. 
A collaboration between scientists from the Iran National Museum, the University of Poiters, 
and the University of Bordeaux confirmed that the tooth was actually from a neanderthal child.<br>
<br>
<strong>This is the ﬁrst direct evidence of the Neanderthal presence in the Iranian Zagros.</strong><br>
Jebrael Nokandeh, director of the Iran National Museum said the results of this new study that
was published in the international "Journal of Human Evolution" definitely prove that
Neanderthals lived in the Zagros region.<br>
<br>
The Wezmeh Cave is an archaeological site near Islamabad Gharb, western Iran, around 470 km southwest of the 
capital Tehran.
Since its discovery in 1999 several excavations were done at this site.<br>
The only Natural History Museum in Iran is Zagros Paleolithic Museum Kermanshah, established by Fereidoun Biglari 
and A. Moradi Bisetouni in 2008. 
The museum contains a large collection of stone tools and animal fossil bones from various Paleolithic sites in Iran. <br>
Zagros Paleolithic Museum occupies four rooms which include objects from various Paleolithic and Neolithic sites in Iran,
 dating from ca. 1,000,000 years to some 8,000 years ago.

and one of the stamps from strip "Word Congress on Avicenna / Ibn Sina, Hamadan" from 2004, as well as  
on the cachet of its <a href="../images/fdc/others/iran_2004_fdc.jpg">FDC</a> and the postmark. <br>
The Mausoleum of Avicenna is a monumental complex located at Avicenna Square, Hamadan, Iran. 
Dedicated to the Persian polymathAvicenna, the complex includes a library, a small museum, and a
