<strong>Israel</strong>, officially known as the State of Israel is a country in the Middle East, on
the southeastern shore of the Mediterranean Sea and the northern shore of the Red Sea. 
It has land borders with <a href="lebanon.html">Lebanon</a> to the north, Syria to
the northeast, <a href="jordan.html">Jordan</a> on the east, respectively, and <a href="egypt.html">Egypt</a> 
to the southwest. 
It contains geographically diverse features within its relatively small area.<br>

<p>Following World War II, the British withdrew from their mandate of
Palestine, and the UN partitioned the area into Arab and Jewish states,
an arrangement rejected by the Arabs. 
Subsequently, the Israelis defeated the Arabs in a series of wars without ending the deep tensions
between the two sides. 
Israel's financial center and technology hub is Tel Aviv. 
Jerusalem is the proclaimed capital. <sup><a href="#r1">[R1]</a></sup>
</p>	
	
<br>
<a name="philately"></a>
The State of Israel has published postage stamps since gaining independence on May 14, 1948. 
The first postage stamps were issued two days later on May 16, 1948.

<a name="A1"></a> [A1] On February 11, 2014 Post authority of Israel issued a set of 3 stamps 
"<a href="../description/stamps/others/israel_2014.html">Makhtesh – Ancient Erosion Craters in Israel</a>", 
one of these stamps shows Makhtesh Ramon. <br>
<p>
	<strong>Makhtesh Ramon</strong>, located near Mitzpe Ramon, is a geological feature of Israel's Negev desert. 
	Located at the peak of Mount Negev, some 85 km south of the city of Beersheba, the landform is not an impact 
	crater from a meteor nor a volcanic crater formed by a volcanic eruption, but rather is the world's largest "erosion cirque"
	The formation is 40 km long, 2–10 km wide and 500 meters deep, and is shaped like an elongated heart. 
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 60px;">
	<strong><em>Makhtesh – Ancient Erosion Craters in Israel</em></strong><br>
     The dynamic earth has formed almost unique geological landforms in the Negev desert. 
	 Initially, a layered sequence of hard limestone and dolomite rocks was deposited over softer sandstone sediments. 
	 The sequence was folded into asymmetric folds, producing four parallel, northeast - southwest, topographical ridges. 
	 An erosion surface removed the hard limestone and dolomite rocks of the fold’s crest, exposing the underlying friable sandstone, 
	 which was eroded, forming a deep transverse valley. 
	 The creeks drain into the Dead Sea - Arava valley, through a single outlet, incised into the southeastern flank. 
	 The closed valleys are surrounded by steep cliffs, 200–400 m high. 
	 A This type of breached valley or erosion crater of this sort is known as a “makhtesh”. 
	 A makhtesh is a “geological window”, through which the ancient strata are revealed.
	A makhtesh contains a variety of different colored rocks, and diverse fauna and flora. 
</p>

<p>
	Makhtesh Ramon is a geologist's paradise with fossils, rock formations and volcanic and magmatic phenomenon 
	dating back as much as 220 million years. 
	The Ramon crater began forming when the ocean that covered the desert began to move north. 
	The geological map of Makhtesh Ramon area is illustrated on the first day cover 
	of "Geology of the land of Israel" stamps from <a href="israel.html#2002">2002</a>.

	It has been designated as a national geological park. 
	Many fossils were historically unearthed from the north-eastern edge of the crater. 
	These fossils included ammonoids, shark teeth, and petrified wood. 
	Some of these fossils are depicted on the illustration of the <a href="../images/fdc/israel_2014_fdc.jpg">FDC</a>.

<p>Four caves (Tabun, Gamal Nahal and Es-Skhul Cave)
are carved into the mountain on the southern slope
of Mount Carmel, at the entrance to the Nahal Me'arot Caves.
Archeological excavations conducted at the site from 1928 to the
present have discovered evidence of human existence near and inside the
caves over hundreds of thousands of years. 
Among the many findings were remnants of houses, various stone tools, jewelry, 
bones of animals used for food and graves.<br>

Neanderthals may have lived side by side with early humans and possibly interbred
with them, according to new research. 
Stone axes and sharp  flint arrowheads of both branches of the human race have been discovered in
limestone caves in northern Israel. <br>
The findings have led archeologists to believe the two sub-species found harmony in a coastal
mountain range that today is in a state of war with its neighbours. 
None of the bones uncovered at Nahal Me'arot - a World Heritage site -
had lethal wounds which suggested prehistoric men lived in peace with
each other 80,000 years ago. <sup><a href="#r4">[R4]</a></sup><br>

<a name="A3"></a> [A3] Saul Adler (1895-1966), was one of Israel's most outstanding scientists 
and his scientific contributions in a number of fields earned him wide international recognition. <br>
Adler specialized in tropical medicine.
In 1924 he was appointed as a research fellow at the Hebrew University, became Professor in 1928 
and was a Head of the Department of Parasitology until his retirement in 1965. <br>
In addition to his great scientific knowledge, he was a Hebrew and Yiddish scholar 
and was as much at home with Elizabethan poetry as with classical and modern Hebrew literature. 
He was an inquiring and enthusiastic student of natural history, and a mathematician of considerable ability. <br>

<strong>Notes:</strong><br>
<a name="NP1"></a> [NP1] In February 1998, Post Authority of Israel issued a set of three stamps 
"50 years since the War of Independence".  <br>

The stamps were issued as separate sheets and in one common mini-sheet. 
These stamps represent the three battle fronts of Israel: 
<ul style="margin-top: 0px;">
	<li>the central front, represented by the battles at the Castel, on the outskirts of Jerusalem, 
		between the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 9<sup>th</sup> of April 1948
		</li>
	<li>the northern front, represented by the battle for Zefat
		and liberation of the Jewish quarter in Zefat in May 1948 
		</li>
	<li>the southern front represented by the raising of the Israeli flag in Eilat on March
		10th, 1949, marking the termination of combat in the War of
		Independence. 
		</li>
</ul>

Every stamp shows some scenes from the battles on a the top side and modern landscapes of the cities on the bottom. <br>
If you look closely at the margin of the mini-sheet to the right of the Zefat stamp, 
a sketch of a mounted skeleton of a <strong>dinosaur</strong> is present in the bottom right margin.

Zefat, sometime written as Tsfat or Sefat, is a small city with population of 30.000. 
Since the 16<sup>th</sup> century, Zefat has been considered one of Judaism's Four Holy Cities, 
along with Jerusalem, Hebron and Tiberias; since that time, the city has remained a centre  of Kabbalah,
also known as Jewish mysticism. <br>
There are only a few museums in the city, none of which focus on natural history.<br>
In addition to its title as the city of Kabbalah, Safed is also known as a city of art. 
Many creative souls are attracted to and inspired by the winding, narrow, cobblestone streets of Safed's Old City, 
home to a bustling artists' quarter. 
Many small and mid-size art galleries are located in the old-city. <br>
<br>
One of the galleries belongs to Arik Amir, who is also known as "Arik the Animal Mimic" and "Arik the Sculptor", 
who was born in Tel Aviv in 1922.<br>
In 1965 he purchased a ruined building in the artists' colony in the enchanted city of Zefat, 
which he renovated and called it "God's Little Acre". 
During the schools' summer vacation, he commenced sculpting in iron, creating hundreds of sculptures. 
His home, "God's Little Acre" became a gallery with a permanent display of his works, and thousands of
visitors from Israel and all over the world flocked to see it. <br>
In the early 1980's, he produced many modern and fantastic animal iron sculptures. 
One of the biggest sculptures he made is 8m high stylized dinosaur, which stood outside of his
gallery and attracted many visitors to the gallery. <br>
The <strong>iron-dinosaur</strong> appeared in newspapers and some postcards issued this time. 
Perhaps, the stamp designer used one of these cards as a source for his work.<br>
<em>Unfortunately, the dinosaur on the stamp is just an art object, not a
fossil and does not represent any known species.</em><br>
